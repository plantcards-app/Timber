/*
  plant-sense.js — an independent second pass over every card's FACTS.

    node tools/plant-sense.js            report contradictions
    node tools/plant-sense.js --strict   exit 1 on any contradiction (for CI)
    node tools/plant-sense.js --json     machine-readable

  WHY THIS EXISTS
  Cards are researched in batches and verified once per batch, which is fast but
  shallow: a wrong thirst or care rating is not obviously wrong on its own, so it
  sails through. This pass cannot check a fact against the world — it has no
  sources — but it CAN check every card against ITSELF. A card that says
  "drought tolerant once established" in prose and carries thirst 18 out of 20 is
  wrong somewhere, and which half is wrong is a question a human can answer fast.

  That is the whole design: turn "is this card right?" (unanswerable at a glance,
  128 times over) into "these 9 cards disagree with themselves" (answerable).

  Every rule below fires only on a genuine internal contradiction, never on a
  blank — a blank is an honest "not entered yet" and is reported separately as
  coverage, not as an error. Rules are deliberately conservative: this tool
  should almost never cry wolf, because a noisy checker gets ignored.
