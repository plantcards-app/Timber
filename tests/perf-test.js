/* perf-test.js — locks in the deck's compositing budget.
   Run: NODE_PATH=/opt/node22/lib/node_modules node tests/perf-test.js  (server on :8477)

   The deck holds every plant in the DOM at once — as SHELLS. A buried card is one
   empty element that keeps its place in the stack; only the top BUILD_DEPTH carry
   their ~145 nodes of content (timber.html dealCards / buildCard). Of those, only the
   top few are ever visible, so only those may be PAINTED and only the ones that MOVE
   may be promoted to their own GPU layer.

   Two regressions this catches, both of which shipped once and glitched swiping on a
   real phone:
     · will-change on every card -> 57 compositing layers (~200MB of GPU layer memory),
       which also defeats occlusion culling
     · painting every buried card -> the browser holds a decoded bitmap for all 54 photos
   The third check is the guard rail on the fix: hiding buried content must not change a
   single pixel, because ~30 stacked box-shadows are what build the deck's halo. */

     Every card wears the same painted furniture: the parchment plaque, the soil
     panel, the aspect band, the hardiness crest, the two spine patches, the sun
     pip, the growth diamond and fifteen rating widgets. Until 2026-09-15 each of
     those was an <img>, so the deck built 38 image elements per card for 15
     shared files — 13,546 <img> at deck 348, against 360 now. They are CSS
     backgrounds instead, which is what .wisp has always done.

     Why this is worth a permanent check rather than a one-off cleanup: the
     regression is invisible. Adding `<img src="art/...">` to renderCard looks
     harmless in a diff and renders identically — it costs nothing until the deck
     is a few hundred cards deep on a phone, which is exactly where this app has
     already hit Safari's "A problem repeatedly occurred", and the deck only ever
     grows.

     and stayed red. It was NOT a defect, and the evidence is worth keeping so
     nobody re-tightens it blind:

       - Bisected, not assumed. The previous commit (deck 171) passed 14/14 on
         the same port; the next one failed with identical numbers every run.
       - The differing pixels were dumped with coordinates. Fifteen of the first
         sixteen were a vertical run at x=764, y=1311-1325 — the outermost edge
         of the deck halo — reading (0,0,0) against (1,1,1). One unit in 255.
       - Unhiding the buried cards makes that edge DARKER, not lighter. Nothing
         is peeking past the top card; it is more `.tcard` box-shadows stacking
         across an 8-bit rounding boundary, which is the cause this check has
         been named after since it was written.
       - It scales with the pile: max delta was 3 at deck 173 and 5 at 194.

     So the intent is unchanged — buried content must not become visible — but
     it is now expressed as "nothing a screen could show" rather than "not one
     bit". The real failure this must still catch is a buried card's CONTENT
     appearing, which means card colours: deltas in the tens or hundreds across
     a region of pixels, orders of magnitude past these bounds.

     The bounds below were not guessed. A leak was staged and measured: one
     buried card un-hidden and nudged 12px so part of it genuinely showed past
     the top card came out at **46882 px, max delta 443** — against a residual of
     17 px at max delta 5. Three orders of magnitude on both axes, so the budget
     is nowhere near being able to swallow a real one. Re-run that measurement
     (scratch script, same procedure as this block) before ever widening it.

     The observed numbers are in the check's own name on every run, passing or
     failing, so the drift stays visible instead of hiding under a threshold. If
     px climbs into the hundreds, or max into the tens, that is a different
     phenomenon and wants looking at rather than another loosening. */
  /* RAISED 2026-08-18, second time, and the two reasons are separate — measured,
     not assumed, by emptying the EDITION registry and re-running the same diff:

       deck 217, no themed cards ....... 17 px, max delta 9
       deck 217, with the two themed ... 98 px, max delta 13

     1. THE BASELINE DRIFTED ON ITS OWN. Same 17 pixels as at deck 194, but the
        max delta went 5 -> 9 purely because 23 more cards stack 23 more shadows
        at that edge. That is the growth this comment predicted.
     2. THE TWO THEMED CARDS ADD ~81 px. Their `backdrop-filter` samples what is
        painted behind, so a themed card's pixels depend on whether buried cards
        are hidden. Confined to cards that opt in; empty EDITION and it returns
        to the 17 px baseline exactly.

     A `filter:` on the card was a THIRD cause and was removed rather than
     tolerated: drop-shadow rendered the whole card to its own buffer and moved
     22510 px by up to 39. This check caught it before it shipped, which is the
     entire argument for having kept the assertion tight.

     The margin is re-measured, not inherited: a staged leak — one buried card
     un-hidden and nudged 12px so it genuinely showed — diffs at 47173 px, max
     delta 443 on this same deck. That is 480x the pixel budget below. */
  /* DELTA RAISED 2026-08-28, third time, and only the delta — the pixel budget is
     untouched because the pixel count went DOWN. Measured, not assumed:

       residual today (deck 240) ..... 31 px, max delta 26
       staged leak, same procedure ... 36497 px, max delta 375

     The differing pixels were dumped with coordinates again, and they are not
     where they used to be. They are no longer one near-black row: they are the
     deck's TOP CORNERS (x≈30 and x≈749 at y≈302 in the 780x1688 shot) plus two
     thin bands at the card's lower edge, and they carry COLOUR — [18,10,0]
     against [3,0,0], a warm gold. That is the stacked cards' own gold trim in
     the halo, arriving because two new photographs changed which card sits on
     top; the value had hovered at 22-25 for a week before one tipped it over.

     Still not a leak, and the ratio proves it: 1177x on pixels and 14x on delta
     against a real one. Max delta 26 is about 8 per channel on near-black, which
     no screen shows. The pixel budget stays at 256 precisely because that is the
     axis a genuine leak explodes on — 36497 of them — and it must stay tight.

     If the DELTA needs raising a fourth time, stop and look for a colour change
     at the card edge rather than reaching for the number again. */
  /* DELTA RAISED 2026-09-13, fourth time. The instruction above was followed
     before the number was touched, and it is the only reason this is a raise
     rather than a fix. Deck 302 -> 308 tipped it: 302 passed, 308 reads Δ53.

     LOOKED, as instructed. The differing pixels were dumped with coordinates and
     colours (scratch script, same procedure as this block). They sit at x=8-16,
     y=150-159 in a 390x844 shot — x≈16-32, y≈300-318 at DPR 2, which is the SAME
     place the 2026-08-28 entry above recorded: the deck's top corners. They carry
     the same warm gold, brighter: [59,32,11] -> [25,14,5] against that entry's
     [18,10,0] -> [3,0,0]. 68 more cards than at deck 240 stack 68 more gold trim
     edges into that corner. Same phenomenon, larger magnitude.

     A HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED AND KILLED. Those coordinates fall inside the .toxflag
     added in v14.60, which carries filter:drop-shadow — and the entry above records
     a `filter:` as a REAL cause that was removed rather than tolerated. Neutralising
     just that filter and re-measuring:

       .toxflag filter as shipped ..... 122 px, max delta 66
       .toxflag filter neutralised .... 87 px, max delta 72

     The filter costs ~35 px and does NOT drive the peak delta — the delta is higher
     without it. Not the cause; the flag stays.

     MARGIN RE-MEASURED, not inherited, by staging the same leak this block has used
     since it was written — one buried card un-hidden and nudged 12px:

       residual (deck 308) ......... 87 px, max delta 58
       staged leak, same procedure . 9521 px, max delta 322

     Say plainly what that means: the ratios are 109x on pixels and 5.6x on delta.
     The pixel axis still explodes by two orders of magnitude on a real leak and the
     PIXEL BUDGET IS UNTOUCHED at 256 — that axis is doing the discriminating work.
     The delta axis is not: 5.6x is down from 14x and it is getting thin.

     So this is the last time the bare delta should be raised. A fifth time means
     the delta has stopped discriminating, and the check should be re-expressed as
     "every differing pixel lies within N px of the deck's outer edge" — which a
     corner-rounding residual satisfies by construction and a card's content
     appearing does not — rather than loosened again. */
  /* MERGE NOTE 2026-09-02: the block above (live line, 08-28) and the block below (card branch,
     09-02) measured the SAME residual independently — 31 px, max delta 26 at deck 240 — and reached
     the same reading: corner halo, warm trim colour, not a leak. The merged deck is taller again, so
     the wider of the two budgets is kept; the numbers the gate prints on every run stay the record. */

     px, against a card box of 16..764 x 299..1495) and a 15-px run down the
     right edge at x 764 — and the largest deltas are the corner pixels reading
     (18,10,0) with buried cards shown against (2,0,0) with them hidden: the
     warm halo shadows of the pile stacking at the corner rounding, darker with
     more of them, exactly the phenomenon named above and one card taller than
     last time. Nothing off the outline moved. The staged leak was re-run on the
     same deck: **19434 px, max delta 420** — 600x the pixel count and 16x the
     delta of this residual. The delta budget doubles to 48; the pixel budget is
     untouched (31 of 256). If the count climbs into the hundreds, or the pixels
     stop being on the card outline, that is a different phenomenon. */
  const HALO_MAX_PX = 256;     /* 98 at deck 217 with two themed cards; 31 at deck 240 */
  /* RE-EXPRESSED 2026-09-13, exactly as the note above said a fifth raise should be
     handled: the bare delta had stopped discriminating, so it is no longer a gate.

     The delta failed again at Δ79 the moment Oscar's research changed `hue` on 48
     cards — the stacked trim at the corner is literally a different colour now. That
     is not a leak and never was, and raising 64 to 96 would have been the fifth
     loosening of a number that had gone 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 26 -> 53 -> 79 while the thing
     it was meant to catch never moved.

     WHERE the pixels sit discriminates where their brightness does not. Measured, both
     runs on deck 310, staged leak by the same procedure this block has always used:

                      total px    max delta    px >24px INSIDE the card edge
       residual ....       123           79                              39
       staged leak .    36,575          375                          16,687

     Halo rounding hugs the deck's outer edge; a buried card becoming visible puts
     CONTENT inside the card rectangle. That is 428x on the inside-count against 4.7x
     on the delta. So the gates are now total pixels (297x headroom) and inside-count
     (428x), and the max delta is REPORTED on every run so drift stays visible without
     gating on a number that no longer means anything. */
