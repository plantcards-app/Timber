# Timber Card Protocol

Status: **DESIGN ITERATING — not final.** This file is the working agreement for how
plant cards get designed, checked, and shipped. Follow it on every card mockup and
every card that goes into `timber.html`. Update the changelog when Oscar decides
something; never silently drift from a decision recorded here.

## 0. Two rules that exist because breaking them lost data

**0a. Every card field must be listed in `FIELDS` in `tools/plant-data.js`.**
That list is the csv column set, and `plants-tool.js import` rebuilds cards from
it. A field that is not in the list is not in the csv, and an import erases it.
This is not hypothetical: `sunMin` lived on 132 cards and was missing from the
list, so a single import would have wiped the sun-band floor across the whole
deck. Adding a new field means adding it to `FIELDS` **in the same change**.
`tools/data-audit.js` fails if a card carries a field the list doesn't know, and
`plants-tool.js` refuses to write rather than dropping one.

**0b. Both plant blocks are real data.** `PLANTS` is the dealt deck and
`PLANTS_ON_HOLD` is cards parked pending photos. Any tool that reads or writes
one must handle the other — export used to see only `PLANTS`, so a round-trip
deleted every held plant. Use `tools/plant-data.js`; never re-implement the
parsing.

Geometry has an equivalent rule: card-level overlay anchors live in
`data/template-anchors.json` and are applied by `tools/template-geometry.js`.
Change the card height with `--reflow`, not by hand.

## 0c. Holo cards (special editions)

A card can carry its own frame artwork instead of `art/frame-600.png`. Add its
latin-slug to the `HOLO` map in `timber.html`:

```js
const HOLO={'cercis-canadensis-eternal-flame':'art/frame-eternal-flame.png'};
```

That swaps the background and adds the `.holo` class. **Everything else is
unchanged** — crest, plaque, soil panel, band, growth rail and all live text are
the same overlays at the same anchors, so a holo card goes through the same
layout audit as any other and cannot drift on its own.

The standard frame bakes three things into its pixels that a commissioned frame
generally will not, so `.holo` supplies them in CSS:

| Baked into `frame-600.png` | Supplied by `.holo` |
|---|---|
| HEIGHT / SPREAD lettering on the spine | `.railval::before`, from `data-label` |
| DOUBLE TAP TO MASTER strip | `.tcard.holo::after` |
| A green spine the parchment rail patches are tinted for | patches hidden; values set in gold on the artwork |

The master strip sits at ~96% on a holo card rather than the baked ~98.2%,
because the ornate border on the Eternal Flame frame swallows text at that
height. If a future frame has a plain foot, move it back.

**Those three pieces sit on the ARTWORK, not on a panel** — the parchment rail
patch is hidden, so their contrast is whatever the frame gives them. The defaults
are Eternal Flame's warm cream on a red-brown shadow, which is right on a fire
card and illegible on a cool one. A frame that needs different ink says so in its
own entry; unset keys keep the current values, so existing cards do not move:

```js
'some-cool-frame':{
  frame:'art/frame-some-cool-frame.webp',
  ink:'#f4efff',            /* spine values  (--holo-ink) */
  labelInk:'#eee7ff',       /* HEIGHT / SPREAD  (--holo-label-ink) */
  masterInk:'#f7f2ff',      /* DOUBLE TAP TO MASTER  (--holo-master-ink) */
  shadow:'0 1px 3px rgba(26,18,40,.95),0 0 7px rgba(61,42,83,.8)',  /* all three */
},
```

The frame art must still leave those five rectangles flat and dark enough to
carry light type — no ink colour rescues lettering set on a pale silver spine.

### Effects: panels and wisps

A holo entry is a config object, so a card can take its own panel artwork and any
number of animated layers:

```js
const HOLO={
  'cercis-canadensis-eternal-flame':{
    frame:'art/frame-eternal-flame.png',
    plaque:'art/holo/eternal-flame-plaque.png',
    soil:'art/holo/eternal-flame-soil.png',
    band:'art/holo/eternal-flame-band.png',
    swatch:'art/holo/eternal-flame-swatch.png',
    wisps:[
      {src:'art/holo/eternal-flame-wisp.png', anim:'drift', dur:34, opacity:0.55, scale:1.7},
    ],
  },
};
```

**Panels — two commands, and one rule you must not break.**

```sh
node tools/extract-frame-assets.js art/frame-<name>.png <name>
```

Cuts the plaque, soil and band out of the frame at the slot rectangles **read from
the app's own CSS**, flattens each one against the standard parchment with a
multiply, and writes an opaque PNG. It also makes a matching swatch for the value
patches.

The rule: **the panels must stay fully opaque.** The parchment carries baked
SAMPLE values — `Jul–Oct`, `1/5`, `3/5`, `2/5`, lit month chips, filled widget
icons — and the `.patch` swatches exist to hide them before the live values are
printed. Doing the multiply in CSS instead of offline makes the panel translucent,
the samples show through, and every row reads double. That was tried; it looked
exactly as broken as it sounds. Flattening offline keeps the whole patch mechanism
working untouched, and flattening the swatch with the same artwork is what stops
the patches sitting on the panel as beige rectangles.

**Wisps — the generic effect layer.**

```sh
node tools/extract-wisps.js art/frame-<name>.png <name>-wisp --mode shards --region 18,4,74,52
```

Keys an effect out of any artwork onto transparency. `--mode rainbow` keeps
saturated iridescence, `--mode shards` keeps the brightest streaks and spikes,
`--mode bright` keeps everything luminous; `--region x,y,w,h` in percent crops
first, which is how you avoid pulling the border thorns into a layer meant to
drift across the middle.

Each entry in `wisps` becomes one animated layer inside the photo window. Three
generic animations are available and no card needs CSS of its own:

| `anim` | Motion |
|---|---|
| `drift` | slow wander with a little rotation — the base "alive" layer |
| `sweep` | a shine travelling diagonally across the card |
| `shimmer` | breathing glint, no travel |

Constraints the system holds to, and why:

- **Only `transform` and `opacity` animate**, so every layer stays on the
  compositor. `perf-test` guards the layer budget and it does not move.
- **Layers exist only on `.hot` cards** (`.card:not(.hot) .wisps{display:none}`),
  so a 129-card deck never carries three animated elements per card.
- **"Only ever adds light" lives in the ASSETS, not in a blend mode.** This line
  used to promise `mix-blend-mode:screen`; there is no blend mode in the CSS and
  there cannot usefully be one, because `contain:strict` isolates the stacking
  context and the blend never reaches the photograph. It shipped that way once
  and the layer composited plain, structure and all, reading as an image slapped
  on top rather than as light. `extract-wisps.js` keys layers
  bright-on-transparent instead, so plain source-over compositing can brighten
  but never darken. **Author wisp art as light on full transparency.**
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` holds a single frame** rather than hiding the layer,
  so the card keeps its character and simply stops moving.
- `perf-test` pauses all animations before its pixel-parity assertion, because
  that check is about the deep toggle and an animation would break it for
  unrelated reasons.

**Commissioning a new frame:** `FRAME-BRIEF.md` has the exact geometry and a
paste-ready prompt. Note that the Eternal Flame frame came back without the
spine lettering and master strip despite the brief asking for them, and with the
plaque and soil panels drawn in despite the brief saying not to — those drawn
panels happen to sit within ~0.5% of the real overlay slots, so the real
parchment covers them and no harm is done. Measure a returned frame with the
same method before wiring it in.

## 1. Card anatomy (current draft — v2)

- **Wood-grain frame** on all four sides (~13px, CSS gradients, original — no copied
  artwork). Rounded corners.
- **Photo is the cornerstone.** It fills the card edge-to-edge inside the frame,
  ≥50% of it clearly visible. Everything else floats over it in panels.
- **Top paper panel** (slim): common name, hardiness pill (top-right, gold), latin
  name in italic + 🔊 pronunciation.
- **Bottom paper panel**: fact oblongs (Water / Position / Soil / Prune), hue-tinted
  type strip, footer hint (⇅ double-tap) + tree-ring stamp.
- **Paper style**: aged vintage — cream base, subtle grain noise, coffee-ring and
  blotch stains, browned edges. Classy-worn, not dirty. Dark ink text on paper;
  white shadowed text only ever sits directly on photo.
- **Compass, not sun icon, for Position** when the aspect data names a direction
  (S, S/W, N-facing…): small compass rose with the stated direction(s) highlighted.
  If the data has no direction, use the plain wording without a compass — NEVER
  invent a facing the data doesn't state.
- Hue strip colour comes from the plant's `hue` field.
- **Plant Power Points** (Oscar's call, v5): playful 0–100 ratings rendered as
  star rows — data lives in real CSV columns, never invented at render time.
  Front shows the four Power Points; `lightLevel` is a spectrum slider for the
  card back. Blank score = row simply not shown (never a fake value).

## 1b. Plant Power Points rubric — SUPERSEDED by CARD-STATS.md

> **The authoritative stat spec is now `CARD-STATS.md`** (0–20 icon scale mapping 1:1
> to the quarter-fill widgets, sun need 0–100, plus the latin/soil checker features
> and the factual-field rules). The 0–100 table below is the earlier model, kept for
> history — where the two differ, CARD-STATS.md wins.

Ratings are **editorial judgements against this rubric**, not measurements.
Generated by AI against the anchors below, then reviewed by Oscar — he outranks
the rubric. Stored in columns 26–30 of plants.csv.

| column | meaning | anchor examples |
|---|---|---|
| powerSeasonal | Visual drama across the whole year | flowering cherry ≈95 (blossom+autumn), Nandina ≈85 (colour shift+berries), plain Leyland hedge ≈15 |
| powerGrowth | Vigour — speed to establish and fill space | Leyland ≈95, Buddleja ≈90, Japanese maple ≈25 |
| powerPest | Pest & disease resistance / trouble-free-ness | Choisya ≈90, rose ≈40, box ≈30 (blight) |
| powerWater | Water thrift — 100 thrives on minimal water | lavender ≈90, Kniphofia ≈80, Hydrangea ≈30 |
| lightLevel | Position on light spectrum, NOT quality: 0 deep shade → 50 part shade → 100 blazing full sun | Sarcococca ≈15, Choisya ≈65, lavender ≈95 |

## 2. Content QA checklist — run on EVERY card before showing Oscar

- [ ] **Photo focal point**: the identifying feature is centred or given an explicit
      `object-position`; nothing important cropped off. Barcodes/labels not dominant.
- [ ] **Photo is the right plant** — matches the name Oscar supplied; if unsure, ask,
      don't assume.
- [ ] **No duplicate phrases across fields** — e.g. "well-drained" belongs in Soil
      OR Water, not both. Water = moisture regime; Soil = soil type/drainage.
      Trim drafted (Gemini/AI) text; it repeats itself.
- [ ] **Caption/visual line ≤ ~90 chars** at card size; trim drafted text to fit.
- [ ] **Compass rule** respected (see anatomy) — direction shown only if data states it.
- [ ] **Commercial fields**: blank stays blank. Never a guessed price/margin on a card.
- [ ] **Hardiness pill** matches the data row; latin spelling eyeballed.
- [ ] **Contrast**: dark ink on paper, shadowed white on photo, nothing marginal.
- [ ] **Render + screenshot + look at it** before sending. Measured, not assumed
      (frame padding equal on all sides; panels not overlapping).

## 3. Iteration workflow

1. Mock the change in scratchpad HTML (never straight into `timber.html`).
2. Screenshot, send to Oscar, get feedback.
3. Record his decisions in the changelog below.
4. When he declares the design FINAL: implement once in `renderCard()` in
   `timber.html` — every card (old and new) re-renders through that one template
   automatically. The only per-plant work is photos + focal points; no manual
   re-mapping of old cards.
5. Full Playwright suite must stay green before push.

## 4. Per-plant photo register

Photos live in `photos/<latin-slug>.jpg` (1200px wide, EXIF-corrected, ~250KB).

| Hydrangea 'Sweet Cupcake' | hydrangea-macrophylla-sweet-cupcake.jpg | ~50% 45% — [flag] photo is a blue/purple mophead close-up, not the pink cultivar |
| Cornus kousa 'Flower Tower' | cornus-kousa-flower-tower.jpg | centre (default 50% 40%) — leaf close-up, arcuate kousa veining; no bracts or columnar habit in shot, re-shoot at bloom if wanted |
| Ajuga 'Burgundy Glow' | ajuga-reptans-burgundy-glow.jpg | spike, 57% 45% — [flag] cropped from an AI-remade card image titled 'Pink Lightning'; cultivar unverifiable from artwork; 680px source, below the 1200px standard |
| Spiraea 'Double Play Doozie' | spiraea-double-play-doozie.jpg (merged) / -flowers.jpg / -leaf.jpg | cluster, 55% 38% — merged: leaf photo full-bleed + sharp bud cluster soft-windowed (v3 recipe, first live use); both source photos staged |
| Potentilla 'Pink Beauty' | potentilla-fruticosa-pink-beauty.jpg | flower, 25% 32% — [flag] blooms in photo are near-white with a faint blush, not deep pink; consistent with the cultivar's documented heat fade (and it was shot in a July heat spell) but unverifiable; orange potentilla visible in background (mixed bench) |
| Cercis chinensis 'Avondale' | cercis-chinensis-avondale.jpg | leaf, 45% 30% — glossy cordate Cercis foliage; no flowers in shot (Apr–May bloomer, shot in July); cultivar unverifiable from leaves, re-shoot at bloom if wanted |
| Prunus lusitanica 'Angustifolia' | prunus-lusitanica-angustifolia.jpg | leaf, 50% 35% — narrow glossy leaves + red stems (species-confirming feature); no racemes in shot (June bloomer, July shot) |
| Salvia 'Blue Spire' | salvia-blue-spire.jpg | 55% 35% — dissected grey-green leaves, felted stems, violet-blue buds breaking; species-confirming, best-verified photo of the batch |
| Mahonia japonica | mahonia-japonica.jpg | bronze young shoot, 25% 50% — spiny pinnate leaflets confirm mahonia; sharp zone is the bronze new growth, mature green foliage soft-focus; replaced the mis-sent Leycesteria shot |
| Buddleja 'Pugster Orchid' | buddleja-pugster-orchid.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 62% 30% — [special] Oscar sent a transparent-background CUTOUT, not a garden photo. Composited onto the card's own hue-315 fallback gradient (composite-cutout.js) so it reads as a specimen plate; raw cutout kept as -cutout.png for re-compositing |
| Salix 'Hakuro-nishiki' | salix-integra-hakuro-nishiki.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 28% — [special] cutout composited over a darkened+blurred copy of ITSELF (hero-on-self, composite-hero.js, hue 130) per Oscar's "darken the background, slap the boy on top in full colour"; melts into the card's dark frame with no seam; raw cutout kept |
| Plumbago auriculata | plumbago-auriculata.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 30% — [special] cutout, hero-on-self composite (hue 215, dark navy backdrop); blue flowers pop; raw cutout kept |
| Euonymus japonicus 'Aureomarginatus' | euonymus-japonicus-aureomarginatus.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 30% 28% — [special] cutout, hero-on-self (hue 50). NOTE filename is the LATIN-slug (aureomarginatus), NOT the JSON id (elegantissimus-aureus) — staged under the id first and shipped blank; caught, now an audit rule |
| Monarda didyma 'Bubblegum Blast' | monarda-didyma-bubblegum-blast.jpg | flower, 78% 18% — real garden shot; hot-pink whorl top-right, leaves show minor mildew spotting (true to the species) |
| Carpinus betulus | carpinus-betulus.jpg | leaf, 55% 40% — pleated corrugated doubly-serrate leaves, textbook hornbeam; species positively confirmed from foliage |
| Elaeagnus ×submacrophylla | elaeagnus-submacrophylla.jpg | leaf, 45% 48% — silver-scaled leaf undersides (the ID feature) sharp in centre; species confirmed |
| Gunnera manicata | gunnera-manicata.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 35% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 120). ⚠ UK-RESTRICTED plant — see compliance note in changelog v12.21 |
| Acer rubrum 'October Glory' | acer-rubrum-october-glory.jpg | leaf, 50% 62% — red petioles (the A. rubrum ID feature) on summer-green leaves; species confirmed |
| Fatsia japonica 'Tsumugi-shibori' | fatsia-japonica-tsumugi-shibori.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 30% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 120). Filename uses the true cultivar 'Tsumugi-shibori' NOT the selling name 'Spider's Web' (apostrophe breaks the slug/checker) |
| Griselinia littoralis | griselinia-littoralis.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 55% 22% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 95, apple-green); glossy oval leaves |
| Indigofera himalayensis 'Silk Road' | indigofera-himalayensis-silk-road.jpg | 55% 15% — real photo; pinnate leaves + lilac-pink pea spikes against a moody sky, focus high to skip the blurred foreground |
| Phalaenopsis Hybrid Group | phalaenopsis-hybrid-group.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 40% 25% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 320 magenta, chosen from the visible bloom colour not the JSON's foliage default) |
| Viburnum tinus 'Eve Price' | viburnum-tinus-eve-price.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 45% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 330); glossy leaves + metallic blue-purple berries in umbels, species-confirming |
| Paeonia 'Orange Victory' | paeonia-orange-victory.jpg | 50% 45% — real photo; divided foliage + red semi-woody Itoh stems (species-consistent); no blooms in shot |
| Lavandula stoechas 'Anouk Deluxe Purple' | lavandula-stoechas-anouk-deluxe-purple.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 45% 25% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 275); rabbit-ear bracts confirm L. stoechas |
| Citrus × meyeri 'Meyer' | citrus-meyeri-meyer.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 30% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 45 gold); glossy citrus foliage, no fruit in shot |
| Euonymus japonicus 'Green Spire' | euonymus-japonicus-green-spire.jpg | 50% 45% — real photo; dense glossy plain-green foliage (distinct from the deck's gold-margined 'Aureomarginatus') |
| Ilex crenata 'Jenny' | ilex-crenata-jenny.jpg | 30% 55% — real photo; fine glossy small leaves on twiggy stems, species-consistent (the box-blight-safe box substitute) |
| × Cuprocyparis leylandii 'Gold Rider' | cuprocyparis-leylandii-gold-rider.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 30% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 55 gold); brilliant golden conifer sprays |
| Rhododendron 'Horizon Monarch' | rhododendron-horizon-monarch.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 45% 20% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 48); leathery whorled foliage + developing bud, no open truss |
| Acer palmatum 'Ōsakazuki' | acer-palmatum-osakazuki.jpg | 50% 45% — real photo; palmate leaves + red petioles, species-confirmed; slug folds the macron ō→o |
| Musa basjoo | musa-basjoo.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 20% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 120); huge paddle leaves; nursery barcode in source sits below the visible band |
| Cornus controversa 'Variegata' | cornus-controversa-variegata.jpg | 42% 48% — real photo; cream-margined arcuate-veined leaves, species-confirmed; focus left of the background pot/paving |
| Olea europaea | olea-europaea.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 45% 30% — [special] cutout hero-on-self (hue 75); narrow silver-grey leaves, species-confirmed |
| Acer palmatum 'Bloodgood' | acer-palmatum-bloodgood.jpg (composited) / -cutout.png | 50% 22% — [special] single dark red-purple palmate leaf, hero-on-self (hue 350); second Acer palmatum (pair with Ōsakazuki) |
| Salvia 'Hot Lips' | salvia-hot-lips.jpg | 40% 45% — real photo; red + red/white bicolour lipped flowers, cultivar-confirmed; focus off the finger top-right |
| Magnolia HONEY TULIP ('Jurmag5') | magnolia-honey-tulip-jurmag5.jpg | 40% 48% — real photo; single honey-yellow goblet flower in hand, cultivar-consistent; focus left of the hand |
| Eryngium × olivierianum BIG BLUE ('Myersblue') | eryngium-olivierianum-big-blue-myersblue.jpg | 35% 50% — real photo; electric-blue spiny flowerheads, species-confirmed |
| Lonicera × purpusii 'Winter Beauty' | (no photo — gradient fallback) | supplied photos were a water lily (wrong plant) + a cat blocking the Lonicera (label-confirmed ID); needs a winter shot of the scented cream flowers on bare stems |
| Leycesteria 'Golden Lanterns' | leycesteria-formosa-golden-lanterns.jpg | 40% 55% — golden red-rimmed leaves + claret lantern bracts, species-confirming; the photo originally mis-sent with the Mahonia JSON |
| Euonymus alatus | euonymus-alatus.jpg | ~50% 40% — summer macro. ID confirmed: corky wings visible as tan ridges on the green stems, leaves opposite + finely serrate. Shows none of the card's headline interest (autumn crimson, fruit); a September re-shoot would sell the plant better |
| Cornus kousa | cornus-kousa.jpg | **50% 52%** — real photo, Oscar's; deep rose-pink bracts, gravel bed behind. Default 50% 40% clipped the hero bloom's lower bracts behind the stats plaque; raised so the whole four-bract shape and the green button clear it, since bract *shape* is the identifiable feature here. **The cultivar is NOT known and is deliberately not guessed** — the card is species-level with `cvs` reading "unnamed pink form". What the photo does establish: narrow finely-acuminate bracts, colour deep and uniform while the central head is still tight and green, so it is a genuinely pink selection rather than a white form ageing pink. Bract length ≈ leaf length rules out 'Venus'; the narrow points argue against 'Heart Throb'. See VERIFY-QUEUE item 9 |
| Hamamelis × intermedia 'Jelena' | hamamelis-intermedia-jelena.jpg | 50% 40% (default) — real photo, Oscar's; backlit copper-orange ribbons on bare stems against blue winter sky, frost on the ground behind. Cultivar-confirming: the copper-orange colour with red bases is exactly what separates 'Jelena' from the deck's yellow 'Arnold Promise'. Second Hamamelis × intermedia, so the pair works like the two Acer palmatums |
| Hydrangea serrata | hydrangea-serrata.jpg | **45% 16%** — real photo, Oscar's; nursery shot, unusually tall crop (1200×2768). The default 50% 40% showed only the red autumn foliage and clipped the flowers off the top edge, which fought the card's own Jul-Sep bloom band. Raised to 16% so a white lacecap head sits in frame WITH the red leaves — flower form and autumn colour both visible. ⚠ The lacecaps here are WHITE with pink-red fertile centres while the card's hue is 220 (blue, the species archetype) — see VERIFY-QUEUE item 6; there is a nursery label in the shot that may name the cultivar |
| Reynoutria japonica | reynoutria-japonica.jpg | 50% — [special] **AI composite, not a field photo** (Ajuga v12.5 class): broad shovel leaves on a zig-zag stem over a fire/lightning treatment. The dramatic ground is deliberate — Oscar's call that a NEVER-STOCK invasive should read as dangerous on sight. Leaf shape and stem habit are ID-true; the red-flecked hollow cane the card's `visual` names is NOT visible, so this sells the danger better than it teaches the ID. A real cane-and-leaf shot would be the stronger teaching photo. ⚠ UK-INVASIVE plant — compliance carried the Gunnera way (v12.21) |

| Rosemary 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' | salvia-rosmarinus-miss-jessopp-s-upright.jpg | 50% 45% — real photo, Oscar's; whorled needle leaves with rolled margins on a woody grey stem, genus/species-confirming. **The cultivar is not verifiable from a foliage macro** — 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' is told from other rosemaries by HABIT, and a close-up shows no habit. Filed on Oscar's own statement that it is the same variety as the held card, not on the photograph. Source is portrait once EXIF rotation is applied (the raw file reads landscape), so only the vertical position bites; a fingertip at the far left edge falls under the stats plaque |
| Acer palmatum 'Sango-kaku' | acer-palmatum-sango-kaku.jpg | 52% 45% — real photo, Oscar's; coral-red stems behind butter-yellow and orange palmate leaves. Cultivar-confirming rather than species-only: the coral bark IS the cultivar, and it is in the same frame as the foliage. Third Acer palmatum in the deck (with Ōsakazuki and Bloodgood), distinct slug |
| Nerium oleander | nerium-oleander.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-15**) | 50% 40% default — swapped for a photo Oscar sent to replace the previous image. Pink five-lobed flowers with narrow leathery leaves in whorls against sky; species-confirming, and it now matches the plain phone-camera character of the rest of the deck rather than reading as a stock bokeh plate. Old file not kept |
| Corylus avellana 'Contorta' | corylus-avellana-contorta.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-15**) | 50% 22% — swapped on Oscar's instruction. The old frame showed one twisted stem behind a lot of leaf; this one has several corkscrew stems reading at once, which is the whole point of the plant. Focus raised from the 50% 40% default because the source is unusually tall (810×1200 after staging) and the default pushed the best stems off the top; 22% keeps them in the band above the plaque. Crumpled rounded hazel leaves confirm it |

| Verbena bonariensis | verbena-bonariensis.jpg | 50% 10% — real photo, Oscar's, **no C2PA manifest at all** (the clean original of a frame first offered inside an AI-merged two-panel composite, refused; see VERIFY-QUEUE 34). Flat-topped head of small five-lobed lilac flowers, species-confirming, with a honeybee taken by a white crab spider on it — the pollinator story the card sells, in the photograph. Focus pushed high because the head sits in the top third and the default dropped it behind the plaque |

| Rhus typhina 'Dissecta' | rhus-typhina-dissecta.jpg | 50% 50% — real photo, Oscar's, clean capture. Fern-like dissected leaflets fill the frame, which is exactly the character that made this photo wrong for the plain-species card (VERIFY-QUEUE 33) and right for this one. The plain *Rhus typhina* card remains held and still wants simple pinnate leaflets — **do not let these two photos swap** |
| Catalpa × erubescens 'Purpurea' | catalpa-erubescens-purpurea.jpg | 45% 50% — real photo, Oscar's; the canopy shot from below against sky, leaf shape and the branching pattern both legible. Note the card sells "black-purple young leaves" and the frame shows mature green foliage with one bronze-purple cluster at centre — species and habit confirming, cultivar colour only hinted. A spring reshoot of the purple flush would sell the plant harder |

| Muehlenbeckia complexa | muehlenbeckia-complexa.jpg | 50% 45% — real photo, Oscar's; wiry red-brown stems with tiny rounded leaves, the whole character of the plant in one frame. Deck's first Muehlenbeckia |
| Astrantia major 'Star of Love' | astrantia-major-star-of-love.jpg | 62% 35% — real photo, Oscar's; wine-red pincushions with the pointed bracts legible. A nursery label is in the lower left of the source, pushed out of the card window by the focus — **check it stays out if the focus is ever retuned** |
| Salvia guaranitica 'Black and Blue' | salvia-guaranitica-black-and-blue.jpg | 50% 100% — real photo, Oscar's, and the one composition to look at before reusing. The source carries a **cut-out leaf sticker with a white outline** pasted over the top-left (his own edit, no AI markers in the file — this is a phone sticker tool, not generative). The card window cannot lose it: the source is 3000×4000 into a 0.84 frame, so the width fits exactly and only ~11% of the height can be cropped away. Focus is set to the bottom of that range, which makes the inset read as a deliberate inset rather than a cut-off smear. A plain flower frame would beat it |
| Hosta 'Broadband' | hosta-broadband.jpg | 35% 45% — real photo, Oscar's; the broad yellow margin against dark green, which IS the cultivar. `check-plant-json` warned its 28-char soil string would overflow the soil panel; it wraps to two lines and does not, so the data was left as he wrote it |

| Anemone × hybrida 'Pretty Lady Emily' | anemone-hybrida-pretty-lady-emily.jpg | 50% 0% — real photo, Oscar's; pale-pink semi-double with the yellow boss, which is the card's own description. Focus pinned to the TOP for a specific reason: **a nursery label for `Achillea` Sassy Summer sits in the bottom of the frame**, belonging to a neighbouring pot. At 0% it falls behind the stats plaque. If this focus is ever retuned downward, that label comes back and the card starts naming the wrong plant |
| Euphorbia characias 'Silver Edge' | euphorbia-characias-silver-edge.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-16**) | 50% 40% default — like-for-like upgrade. **The deck holds three Euphorbias and two of them are variegated**, so this was matched against the cards' own photographs before staging, not by eye alone: the new frame's narrow blue-grey leaves with soft cream margins track the outgoing 'Silver Edge' photo closely, where 'Ascot Rainbow' is unmistakably yellow with an orange-pink flush. Do not let these two swap |
| Coprosma 'Inferno' | coprosma-inferno.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-16**) | 50% 45% — the card sells "leaves deepen purple-brown with vivid red margins **in cold**", and the outgoing frame showed the green-yellow summer state instead. The new one is the cold colouring, i.e. the thing the card is actually about. **The old frame was kept** as `coprosma-inferno-summer.jpg` rather than discarded — same plant, other season, and the card describes both |
| Chamaerops humilis | chamaerops-humilis.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-16**) | 50% 35% — Oscar's call, and he was right: the outgoing frame was a whole plant in a white pot on gravel, most of the card being decking, gravel and a stuck-on label. The new one is a single fan frond filling the window |

| Hypericum × inodorum MIRACLE NIGHT ('Allmadne') | hypericum-inodorum-miracle-night-allmadne.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's; the orange-yellow flower against the purple-flushed foliage, which is exactly what separates NIGHT from GRANDEUR. **The deck now holds three Hypericums** (also × *hidcoteense* 'Hidcote', held) — check the slug, not the genus |
| Hedera helix 'Oro di Bogliasco' | hedera-helix-oro-di-bogliasco.jpg | 50% 40% default — small three-lobed leaves with the gold centre. **The deck's other gold ivy is *Hedera colchica* 'Sulphur Heart'**, whose leaves are large and unlobed — the two photographs must never swap, and leaf shape is what tells them apart |
| Lonicera henryi 'Copper Beauty' | lonicera-henryi-copper-beauty.jpg | 50% 40% default — the bronze-maroon new foliage the cultivar is named for. Foliage only; the card leads on scented orange-yellow tubes (Jun-Aug), so a flower frame would sell it harder |
| Solanum laxum 'Album' | solanum-laxum-album.jpg | 50% 40% default — white stars with the yellow beak, species-confirming |
| Clematis × cartmanii AVALANCHE ('Blaaval') | clematis-cartmanii-avalanche-blaaval.jpg | 50% 40% default — the glossy dissected evergreen foliage, which is half the plant's selling point and the half that is there in August. Card peak is Mar-Apr, so the white flowers want a spring return |
| Weigela PRISM MAGIC CARPET ('VPWG18-06') | weigela-prism-magic-carpet-vpwg18-06.jpg | 50% 100% — pushed to the bottom of its range deliberately: the pink bells sit low in the frame and the default dropped them behind the stats plaque, leaving a card of foliage on a card whose text leads with the flower |
| Geranium 'Bob’s Blunder' | geranium-bob-s-blunder.jpg | 50% 40% default — bronze foliage, red stems, the pale lilac-pink flower. **This is the same file that was parked unidentified in VERIFY-QUEUE 37**, resent with its card; that question is closed. Note the deck's other cranesbill, Rozanne, is still held and looks nothing like this |
| Dahlia ELECTRO PINK ('71853-09') | dahlia-electro-pink-71853-09.jpg | 50% 40% default — neon cactus bloom over the mahogany foliage, both halves of the card in one frame |
| Hypericum × inodorum MIRACLE GRANDEUR ('Allgrandeur') | hypericum-inodorum-miracle-grandeur-allgrandeur.jpg | 50% 40% default — red autumn berries on green foliage. Reads as the deliberate opposite of MIRACLE NIGHT above, which is the useful thing for staff |
| Syringa vulgaris | syringa-vulgaris.jpg | 50% 30% — the weakest frame of the batch and known to be: **foliage only, on a card whose text leads with "fragrant lilac-purple panicles"**. Lilac flowers May-Jun, so it cannot be fixed until spring. Dealt rather than held because a real leaf beats an empty card, but it is first in the queue for a reshoot |

| Tetrapanax papyrifer 'Rex' | tetrapanax-papyrifer-rex.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's; two enormous palmate leaves filling the frame, which is the entire point of this plant. **The one photo in the deck whose SOURCE was cropped before staging, and the reason is arithmetic, not taste:** the file arrived 1244×2960, a ratio of 0.42 against the card window's 0.84. Staging caps the LONG edge at 1200, so the master would have come out **504 px wide** — half the ~1000 px the card renders at, i.e. visibly soft — and object-fit would have thrown away half the height anyway. Cropping to the lower 1244×1500 (the two big leaves, above the tarmac) makes the long edge the *height*, so the master lands at **995×1200** and the card gets its full width of real pixels. Uncropped source kept out of the repo; if it is ever restaged, redo the crop or accept the softness |

| Cornus sericea 'Variegata' | cornus-sericea-variegata.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, and **the file that sat parked as `cornus-variegated-unidentified.jpg` until he named it**; the parked copy was deleted once this card existed. Cream-edged leaves with the purple flush and the red stems, which is the whole card. Fourth Cornus in the deck — check the slug |
| Calycanthus 'Aphrodite' | calycanthus-aphrodite.jpg | 50% 40% default — the one Oscar sent as *"fuck I forgot what thats called"*, parked as `calycanthus-unidentified.jpg`, then named by him. Large magnolia-like purple-red flower with the yellow-tipped centre, cultivar-confirming. Parked copy deleted |
| Syringa vulgaris 'Znamya Lenina' | syringa-vulgaris-znamya-lenina.jpg | 50% 40% default — **this photograph moved here from the plain-species card.** See the changelog: the plant was the cultivar all along. Still foliage only, and the card's text still leads with the flowers, so a May reshoot remains the fix |
| Lonicera periclymenum 'Rhubarb and Custard' | lonicera-periclymenum-rhubarb-and-custard.jpg | 50% 40% default — **a transparent cut-out PNG, not a photograph in the usual sense.** Flattened onto the deck's own dark green (`#0d1408`) before staging, because the app only loads `.jpg` masters and a transparent PNG would have gone black at an arbitrary edge. The white sticker outline reads as deliberate against the frame. The pink-to-custard flower ageing is all in one head, which is exactly what the name promises |
| Lilium formosanum var. pricei | lilium-formosanum-var-pricei.jpg | 50% 0% — pinned to the top for **two** reasons. The trumpets sit in the top third and the default buried them behind the plaque; and the source carries a **visible "AI-generated content" label burned into its lower left**, which the top-anchored window excludes. **That is framing, not concealment** — the marker is recorded verbatim in `CREDITS.json` and the C2PA manifest travels inside the file. Its credentials read `c2pa.edited`, `softwareAgent: Photo assist`, `digitalSourceType: compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`, i.e. VERIFY-QUEUE 32's category |
| Physocarpus opulifolius 'Diabolo' | physocarpus-opulifolius-diabolo.jpg | 50% 40% default — **dealt on Oscar's direct confirmation of the cultivar**, which is the whole reason it was refused twice before: the deck's only ninebark is 'Diabolo' and a dark leaf cannot separate it from 'Summer Wine', 'Lady in Red' or 'Little Devil'. One word from him settled what no amount of looking could |

| Hibiscus syriacus LAVENDER CHIFFON ('Notwoodone') | hibiscus-syriacus-lavender-chiffon-notwoodone.jpg | 50% 100% — real photo, Oscar's, clean. Pushed to the bottom of its range because the flower sits low in the frame; the master is 1200×1600 so only ~11% of height is available to move, and the bloom still shares the window with a leaf. **Second Hibiscus syriacus in the deck** — 'Oiseau Bleu' is the single blue-violet one, this is the lilac semi-double. Also worth knowing: the 'Oiseau Bleu' photograph is one of VERIFY-QUEUE 32's four Galaxy-glyph files, this one is not |
| Viburnum × bodnantense 'Charles Lamont' | viburnum-bodnantense-charles-lamont.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-17**; **the only Bodnant Viburnum card since 2026-09-06**, when the plain-species duplicate wearing the same photo was removed — v14.59) | 50% 40% default — Oscar reshot it deliberately with the shoot **lower in the frame so it lands in the card's photo window instead of behind the stats plaque**, which is the clearest statement yet that the window's geometry is worth shooting for. The new frame also drops the roofline the old one had in the background. The `-leaf.jpg` spare is untouched. Note the deck holds the species *V.* × *bodnantense* as well — different slug, different card |

| Crinodendron hookerianum | crinodendron-hookerianum.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-17**) | 50% 40% default — **this one closes a text-vs-picture gap rather than just upgrading a frame.** The card's `visual` reads *"Crimson lantern-shaped flowers hang beneath narrow glossy evergreen leaves"* and the outgoing photograph had **no flowers in it at all** — a flash-lit night shot of spotted foliage on a black ground. The lanterns ARE the plant. **Second source crop in the deck** (after Tetrapanax) and for the same arithmetic: at 1423×2202 the long-edge cap would have produced a 776 px-wide master against the ~1000 px the card renders. Cropping to the upper 1423×1694 — lanterns and foliage, above the bark mulch and pot rim — makes the long edge the height, so the master lands at 1008×1200 |

| Cercis canadensis CAROLINA SWEETHEART ('NCCC1') | cercis-canadensis-carolina-sweetheart-nccc1.jpg (**collage restored whole 2026-09-06**) | 50% 40% default — **the three-panel collage is back on the card, on Oscar's call**: *"the cropping mechanism [ruined] my lovely collage ... don't crop."* Two close-ups across the top (a new leaf in hot pink, the mottled pink-white-green canopy) over the whole staked young tree against sky. 1086x1448 PNG as supplied, at exactly 0.750, re-encoded JPEG, no pixels generated. On 2026-08-16 it was staged from ONE panel because *"a card window cannot render a three-panel collage without showing a seam"* — that reasoning was retired by v14.53 (one rule: a deliberate two-part identification photo stays whole). The old single panel is kept as the spare `-panel.jpg`. The file's C2PA manifest (`c2pa.actions.v2`) is the collage app's signature and is recorded in CREDITS as before. Third Cercis in the deck, after 'Avondale' and 'Eternal Flame' |
| Elaeagnus × submacrophylla 'Limelight' | elaeagnus-submacrophylla-limelight.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean. Gold-centred leaves with the dark margin. **The deck's other Elaeagnus is the plain × submacrophylla**, whose card sells silver-scaled leaves — the two photographs must not swap, and the gold centre is what separates them at a glance |
| Acer palmatum 'Oridono-nishiki' | acer-palmatum-oridono-nishiki.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean. The half-green half-shocking-pink leaf is the cultivar's whole party trick and it is dead centre. **Fourth Acer palmatum** (Ōsakazuki, Bloodgood, Sango-kaku) |
| Epimedium × perralchicum 'Fröhnleiten' | epimedium-perralchicum-frohnleiten.jpg | 50% 40% default — bronze-red veined young foliage against the green. **Carries a Galaxy AI generative-edit marker** (`Photo assist`, `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`) and a visible "AI-generated content" label in the lower left, recorded verbatim in `CREDITS.json`. VERIFY-QUEUE 32's category, fifth and sixth files now |
| Pittosporum tenuifolium 'Tom Thumb' | pittosporum-tenuifolium-tom-thumb.jpg | 50% 40% default — **dealt on Oscar's explicit confirmation after being held once.** Read the card and the photograph together before reusing either: the `visual` line says *"deep purple-black wavy leaves · lime-green new growth"* and the photograph is magenta and cream variegation. He has confirmed the plant twice; **the card's text is what now needs his eye**, not the picture. VERIFY-QUEUE 41 |
| Rhododendron 'Homebush' | rhododendron-homebush.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean; the dense rose-pink truss the card is sold on. **The card's own data was left exactly as it was**, not replaced by the JSON supplied alongside the photograph — see the changelog, and VERIFY-QUEUE 42 |

| Houttuynia cordata 'Pied Piper' | houttuynia-cordata-pied-piper.jpg | 50% 0% — pinned to the top so the frame's **visible "AI-generated content" label**, bottom-left of the source, falls outside the window; the master is 1200×1529 so ~6.5% of height is available and the label sits inside it. Framing, not concealment — the marker is written verbatim into `CREDITS.json` and the manifest stays in the file. Credentials: `Photo assist`, `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`, i.e. VERIFY-QUEUE 32's category again. The leaves carry the full red-orange-yellow splash **and** a white flower spike, which is the whole card in one frame |

| Agapanthus 'Ovatus' | agapanthus-ovatus.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean. Buds and open trumpets together, which is how the plant is actually sold. **Second Agapanthus** — POPPIN' PURPLE ('PM003') is the other, and note *that* one is a VERIFY-QUEUE 32 sparkle-glyph file while this is not. Small text-vs-picture wrinkle: the card says *"pale-mid blue"* and the photograph reads deep violet-blue. Arguable — agapanthus colour shifts hard with light and phone camera — so his wording was left alone |
| Veronica 'Emerald Gem' | veronica-emerald-gem.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean. Tiny scale-like leaves packed into the dense mound, which is the whole plant. **Filed under *Veronica*, following RHS's move of Hebe into it** — the deck's other one is still `Hebe 'Red Edge'`, so the two now sit under different genera. The `common` field carries "Hebe 'Emerald Gem'" so a staff search for Hebe still finds it |

| Hosta 'Emerald Charger' | hosta-emerald-charger.jpg | 50% 45% — a two-sided compromise worth understanding before retuning. The source is unusually tall (1654×3074) so 36% of its height can be excluded, and the bottom carries a **visible "AI-generated content" label**; 0% hid the label but pushed the foliage behind the plaque, 45% keeps the label out AND brings leaf into the window. Credentials (`Photo assist`, `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`) are in `CREDITS.json`. **Third Hosta, and the risky one:** 'Broadband' is green-centred with YELLOW MARGINS, this is GOLD-CENTRED with green margins — visual inverses. In this frame the gold centre reads only faintly, so the two cards are harder to tell apart by photograph than by text |

| Buddleja davidii LITTLE RUBY ('Botex 006') | buddleja-davidii-little-ruby-botex-006.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean. Spikes at every stage in one frame: open ruby-pink, spent brown, and the tight buds behind, which is what a compact Buddleja actually looks like on a bench in August. **Third Buddleja** (with 'White Profusion' and 'Pugster Orchid') and the only ruby-pink of the three, so no confusion risk |

| Clematis JOSEPHINE ('Evijohill') | clematis-josephine-evijohill.jpg | 50% 40% default — real photo, Oscar's, clean; the layered rosette centre that is the whole reason for this cultivar. **Sixth Clematis** in the deck and the only double — the others are AVALANCHE (dealt) plus four held |
| Sempervivum arachnoideum | sempervivum-arachnoideum.jpg | 50% 40% default — the cobweb hairs are legible, which is the species' one identifying feature. Two nursery labels are in frame; a tidier shot would be better but the plant is unmistakable and it is a real bench photograph |
| Forsythia × intermedia 'Lynwood Variety' | forsythia-intermedia-lynwood-variety.jpg | 50% 40% default — **and read this before reusing it.** The card's `visual` says *"Bare stems buried under brilliant golden-yellow flowers **before a single leaf appears**"*, peak Mar-Apr, and this photograph is nothing but leaves. That is the sharpest text-vs-picture gap in the deck — sharper than the *Syringa*, because this card's wording explicitly denies what its picture shows. Dealt rather than held on the principle that a real leaf beats an empty card, but **it wants a March reshoot before anything else on the list** |
| Euphorbia × martini MINER'S MERLOT ('Km-mm024') | euphorbia-martini-miner-s-merlot-km-mm024.jpg (**replaced 2026-08-17**) | 50% 40% default — a proper rosette from directly above, wine-red midribs against the blue-green, which is the cultivar. **Third Euphorbia photo swapped or checked in two days** — the deck holds three and two are variegated, so every Euphorbia photo now gets matched against the other cards before staging |
| Gunnera manicata (swap frame) | gunnera-manicata-underside.jpg | **PHOTO_SWAP alt at 50% 30%, not a replacement.** The card's own photo is the plant from above — the scale, which is the point. This is the UNDERSIDE, shot from below against sky: leaf ribs and a stem armed with spines, the other half of why people either want this plant or back away from it. Source rotated to its EXIF-correct portrait and cropped so the long edge became the height, which took the master from 675 px wide to 1008 |

| Deutzia × hybrida 'Magicien' | deutzia-hybrida-magicien.jpg | 50% 40% default — **first photo in the deck reframed through `tools/reframe-photo.js`** rather than by hand: crop coordinates written against the card geometry, executed by sharp on the original pixels, no generated content. Second Deutzia (with held *D. gracilis* 'Nikko') and the only pink one |
| Magnolia acuminata | magnolia-acuminata.jpg | 50% 40% default — the cucumber-like aggregate fruit, green flushing red, which is the whole reason for the common name and what the card's `visual` leads on. Also reframed through the tool. **Third Magnolia** (HONEY TULIP, *stellata*) and the only one carrying fruit rather than flower |

| Veronica 'Rhubarb Crumble' | veronica-rhubarb-crumble.jpg | 50% 40% default — **REPLACED 2026-09-02** at Oscar's request: *"we tried to double up the image of the hebe and it came out shit on the card"*. The new master is a clean 3000×4000 frame of the same plant, cream-margined leaves and burgundy buds filling the top two thirds over a concrete slab; no crop needed. The EDITION `mirror` entry is retired with it (the mechanism stays, unused). Previous entry, kept for the record: 50% 40% default — **the clearest case yet for reframing.** As shot, the plant is a spray in the top-right corner of a concrete slab: roughly two thirds of the frame is paving. Cropped through `reframe-photo.js` to a 1:1 on the shoot, which puts the cream variegation AND the burgundy buds — both halves of what the card promises — into the band both surfaces show. **Third Veronica/Hebe in the deck**, and it is the same photograph that was parked as `hebe-variegated-unidentified.jpg` in VERIFY-QUEUE 38; that file is retired now the plant has a name |

| Butia capitata | butia-capitata.jpg | 50% 40% default — shot from below into a white sky, so the crown reads as a silhouette: arching glaucous fronds sweeping out of frame, the stout trunk with its old leaf-base collar, and the **armed petioles** that place it in *Butia* rather than the *Syagrus* its label also named (VQ 47). Reframed through `reframe-photo.js` from 0.561 to 0.780 — the phone frame was far too tall, and half of it was empty sky. A 1:1 crop was tried first and rejected: it read as trunk-and-spines with the arching fronds cut off, which is the half of the plant the card's `visual` leads on. **First palm with pinnate (feather) fronds** — *Chamaerops* is fan-leaved, *Trachycarpus* is held |

| Erigeron karvinskianus 'Profusion' | erigeron-karvinskianus-profusion.jpg | 50% 40% default — a wet macro: the sharp daisy with rain still on its rays, a fresher flower opening beside it, and the green buds behind. **Cropped away from the photograph's own subject.** As shot, the lower 40% of the frame is one enormous out-of-focus bloom shot from inches away; the crop takes the upper half, where everything is actually in focus, and leaves the bokeh below the plaque line. Also the first photo in the register where the CHAT preview and the file disagreed — EXIF orientation 6 means the file displays portrait 3000x4000 while the preview showed the un-rotated sensor frame, so the crop coordinates had to be written against the rotated frame that `reframe-photo.js` (and the app) actually use |

| Lithodora diffusa 'Heavenly Blue' | lithodora-diffusa-heavenly-blue.jpg | 50% 40% default — an August plant in its pot on gravel: dense bristly narrow leaves, the lax habit legible, the grey pot rim cropped off the bottom. **No flowers, and the flush showing is bright mid-green where the card's text says dark-green** — both true of the plant in August, both recorded in VQ 50. Wants an April–July reshoot for the gentian-blue the card leads on |
| Rhodanthemum hosmariense 'Zagora Yellow' | rhodanthemum-hosmariense-zagora-yellow.jpg (**restored whole 2026-09-06**) | **`100% 40%`** — **the collage is back on the card, on Oscar's call** (VQ 57 closed): *"cropping ruined the rhodanthemum card, having the flower image in there is beneficial."* Master is now the supplied two-frame collage (2268x3206, orientation 1) with **only the bottom 5.7% trimmed** (182 px of foliage and a dead seedhead) to bring 0.707 up to the 0.75 aspect gate — the inset is untouched. Restaged 1200x1600. **The focus override is doing real work here**, unlike the Butia's: the master is wider than the 0.551 window so cover crops the SIDES, and X is the axis the override moves. At the default 50% the flower centre lands at 86% of the window width, under the hardiness shield; at 100% it sits at 67%, clear of the shield with the inset's right edge on the window edge, so it reads as a corner panel rather than a floating rectangle. Measured on the render, three candidates side by side. **The flower shown is white; Oscar confirms the plant throws both yellow and white blooms, so the name stands and VQ 49 is closed.** The card's `visual` says so. The 2026-08-18 foliage-only crop is kept in the register history; original file re-sent by Oscar 2026-09-06 |

| Monstera deliciosa | monstera-deliciosa.jpg | 50% 40% default — one mature fenestrated leaf across the whole card band, splits and oval holes both legible, the second leaf and the aerial-rooted stem behind it. The best photograph in this batch and one of the plainest reads in the deck: nothing else in 224 cards looks like it |
| Aloe vera | aloe-vera.jpg | 50% 40% default — **shot into the window**, so the blades read olive-and-dark rather than the "fleshy grey-green" the card names, and the pot fills the lower half of the frame. **Three crops.** The first two put sky and pot in the card band and it read as grass behind glass; the third pulls in to the blades, where the white spotting and the toothed margins are both legible, and drops the pot below the plaque. That is as far as cropping takes this frame — a front-lit shot would be a straight upgrade. VQ 51 |

| Hydrangea macrophylla 'Zorro' | hydrangea-macrophylla-zorro.jpg | 50% 40% default — a plant in tight green bud, not the ultramarine lacecap the card leads on, and **the EXIF says why**: shot 22 May 2024, before the Jun–Sep peak. What it does carry is the cultivar's signature, the **deep purple-black stems**, which is what separates 'Zorro' from every other lacecap. A black nursery label along the bottom-left was cropped out, verified by the tool. **Ninth Hydrangea**, second *macrophylla* lacecap — check against FRENCH CANCAN BLEU before reusing either. VQ 53 |
| Imperata cylindrica 'Rubra' | imperata-cylindrica-rubra.jpg | 50% 40% default — **the best photograph of the day**: backlit crimson-over-green blades filling the frame, which is the entire reason anyone buys this grass. Frame arrived already at 0.75 and inside the gate; the crop only trims the bottom fifth of pots, compost and a white plastic label. Archive shot, 19 July 2024. **Sixth grass in the deck, and one letter from *Pennisetum* 'Rubrum'** — VQ 54 |

| Artemisia 'Powis Castle' | artemisia-powis-castle.jpg | 50% 40% default — **the first photograph this run that needed no crop at all.** The EXIF-rotated frame is already portrait 3000x4000 at exactly 0.75, and already composed: one silvery filigree shoot against sky sitting in the card's own band, the dense mound beneath it. Run through `reframe-photo.js` at `verdict: as-is` purely to bake the orientation into the pixels, so the master is the full 1200x1600 — the largest in the deck this week. Current-season capture, Galaxy S24, 21 Aug 2026 |

| Oenothera lindheimeri 'Rosy Jane' | oenothera-lindheimeri-rosy-jane.jpg | 50% 40% default — **kept WHOLE as a two-frame composite, on Oscar's call.** Foliage left, flowers right, seam at x=0.630. It was first cropped to the flower frame alone; Oscar's correction: *"this shows off both parts of the plant which is helpful for ident"* — and he is right, a garden-centre card is an identification aid before it is a photograph. Restaged at `verdict: as-is`, master back up to the full 1200x1600. **Second *Oenothera lindheimeri*** after GAUDI ROSE; they look nothing alike (30 cm rose-pink over burgundy vs 50–100 cm white picotee over green). VQ 55 |

| Cephalanthus occidentalis 'Bailoptics' | cephalanthus-occidentalis-bailoptics.jpg | 50% 40% default — large glossy opposite leaves with impressed veins on red stems, filling the frame. Already 0.75 with no label and no dead space, so it went through at `verdict: as-is` and nothing was cropped (protocol v14.34, second card running under the new rule). **The one card of three whose photograph was never in doubt** — the only non-*Vitex* plant of the batch, and both possible orderings put this picture with this card. VQ 58 |

| Vitex agnus-castus 'Piivac-I' (Delta Blues) | vitex-agnus-castus-piivac-i.jpg | 50% 40% default — the NARROW-leaflet plant: 5–7 slim leaflets radiating from one point, the *agnus-castus* leaf. Assigned on the LEAVES after the send order and the foliage disagreed; Oscar confirmed (VQ 58). Uncropped, rotation baked in, master 1200x1600 |
| Vitex × 'Bailtexone' (Flip Side) | vitex-bailtexone.jpg | 50% 40% default — the BROAD-leaflet plant: wider leaflets in threes on purple-flushed petioles, the *V. trifolia* leaf this hybrid is bred for. Same resolution as its sibling above and the same reason. **These two cards are otherwise near-identical** — same genus, same First Editions series, both blue, same aspect, soil and pruning — so check the LEAF, not the file order, before ever swapping either photo |

| Eupatorium japonicum 'Pink Frost' | eupatorium-japonicum-pink-frost.jpg | 50% 40% default — cream-white variegation filling the card band, the nursery pot and its dead stems sitting below the plaque line, so **uncropped**. A young plant, not flowering: the card's *"flat pink flower heads"* are the half this photograph does not carry, and July–September is the window for that shot |
| Erysimum 'Bowles's Mauve' | erysimum-bowles-s-mauve.jpg | 50% 40% default — **a held card filled from the rebuilt hold list**, identified by Oscar. Grey-green foliage with the purple-maroon flush, in its pot. Cropped only to drop the lower quarter of bare gravel, which was pushing the plant up out of the card band. No flowers — the card leads on *"purple-mauve spires"*, and this cultivar flowers nearly year-round, so a spire shot is easy to get |
| Cryptomeria japonica Serama ('FM5') | cryptomeria-japonica-serama-fm5.jpg | 50% 40% default — the fasciated, cockscombed shoots that are the entire point of this cultivar, in hard sun. Cropped by **3% off the bottom edge only**, to remove a fingertip holding the branch; nothing else touched. **Second *Cryptomeria*** after 'Globosa Nana', but no confusion risk — that one is a plain rounded dwarf, this one is visibly contorted |

| Styrax japonicus 'Evening Light' | styrax-japonicus-evening-light.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**. The deep purple young foliage fills the card band at 0.877, already inside the gate, and the brick edging behind it is the setting rather than clutter to fix. No flowers: peak is May–Jul and this is August, so the white bells the card also names want a spring frame. **First card to arrive after the LEGAL plaque shipped and light it up** — PBR protected |
| Pinus koraiensis 'Jack Corbit' | pinus-koraiensis-jack-corbit.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, already 0.75. Long soft five-needle bundles filling the frame, which is exactly what separates a Korean pine from everything else in the deck. **Second *Pinus*** after *P. mugo*, and no confusion risk: mugo is short paired needles, this is long and soft |
| Cedrus atlantica (Glauca Group) 'Horstmann’s Silberspitz' | cedrus-atlantica-glauca-group-horstmann-s-silberspitz.jpg **+ PHOTO_SWAP** | 50% 40% default — **a two-frame card**. Primary is the shoot with its creamy-white new tips, the cultivar itself; the swap is the massed blue foliage from two paces back, the other half of the card's own visual line. Shot four seconds apart (EXIF 12:30:27 and 12:30:31), so the two frames are the same plant in the same light. Primary trimmed 7% of width only, to bring 1.075 inside the gate |

| Sanguisorba 'Pink Brushes' | sanguisorba-pink-brushes.jpg | 50% 40% default — **Oscar's own two-frame split, kept whole**: cut foliage left, nodding pink bottlebrushes right. Already 3000x4000 at exactly 0.750, so nothing was cropped. The clearest case yet for the v14.34 rule — he assembled this one deliberately to show both halves, and both halves are what a person needs to recognise the plant on a bench |
| Disporum sessile 'Variegatum' | disporum-sessile-variegatum.jpg | 50% 40% default — held in Oscar's hand in its nursery pot, so the cream-striped leaves read at arm's length. **Bottom fifth trimmed** (`h: 0.78`) and nothing else: as shot, the pot floated the foliage to 27% down the frame, above the card's readable band, and reframe-photo.js refused the as-is until it was fixed. The hand and pot are kept — they are the scale reference. **First *Disporum*** in the deck |
| Campsis grandiflora (Tropical Summer Trumpet Creeper) | campsis-grandiflora.jpg (**replaced 2026-09-04**) | 50% 40% default — **the clearest crop-versus-frame lesson in the register.** The outgoing master was a 1200x1253 macro zoomed so far into a single bloom that the petal was soft and the foliage was gone entirely — on a card whose `visual` leads with *"pinnate dark-green foliage"*, and on a *Campsis*, where the pinnate serrate leaflets are the ID feature and a big orange trumpet is not (*Bignonia*, *Podranea* and *Tecoma* all read the same at that magnification). The replacement is Oscar's supplied frame with **only the bottom 15% removed** — pot, hand and two nursery labels he redacted himself in red marker. That trim is measured, not tasted: the topmost label sits at y 0.560, and a first pass at `h: 0.90` put it at exactly 0.622, the plaque line, which rendered as a visible sliver beside the soil panel; `h: 0.85` puts it at 0.659 and the band is clean. Leaflets fill the left and centre, trumpets upper-right, both in one frame. **First *Campsis*** in the deck |
| Daphne × transatlantica PINK FRAGRANCE ('Blapink') | daphne-transatlantica-pink-fragrance-blapink.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, EXIF orientation 6 (sensor 4000x3000, displays portrait 3000x4000 at exactly 0.750), rotation baked at `verdict: as-is`. Two open clusters of pink-flushed-white flowers with the narrow lance-shaped semi-evergreen leaves filling the frame. **This card exists because a photograph was refused rather than dealt**: `daphne-unidentified-summer.jpg` was sent in August 2026 for the deck's *D. bholua* 'Jacqueline Postill' and parked instead, because that plant flowers Jan–Mar and the picture was in full bloom in August (VERIFY-QUEUE 44). Oscar has now named it PINK FRAGRANCE and supplied this clearer frame. **'Jacqueline Postill' stays HELD** and still wants a winter shot — the two Daphne photographs must never swap, and the season in the frame is what tells them apart. The parked file is kept as the earlier record of the same plant |
| Physocarpus opulifolius ALL BLACK ('Minall2') | physocarpus-opulifolius-all-black-minall2.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, orientation 6 baked, 3000x4000 at 0.750, restaged at the full 1200x1600 rather than `deal-plant.js`'s 900x1200. Dark purple lobed leaves on bright red stems with a crimson new shoot at centre. **Dealt on a LABEL, not a leaf, and the eleven seconds matter**: Oscar sent a photograph of the pot label reading *PHYSOCARPUS OPULIFOLIUS ALL BLACK® 'Minall2' cov* at 17:27:22 and this frame at 17:27:33, so label and plant are the same plant in the same minute — the Cedrus swap-pair precedent used as proof of identity rather than of lighting. Closes VERIFY-QUEUE 60. The earlier bench frame is kept as the spare `physocarpus-opulifolius-all-black-bench.jpg`, renamed off its `-dark-unidentified` name now the plant is known. **Third *Physocarpus***, and read the changelog before touching the other two: this label is what proved the deck had ALL BLACK's and LITTLE DEVIL's cultivar codes crossed |
| Buxus sempervirens (Common Box) | buxus-sempervirens.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, EXIF orientation 6 baked (Galaxy S24, sensor 4000x3000, displays portrait 3000x4000 at exactly 0.750), restaged at the full 1200x1600 rather than `deal-plant.js`'s 900x1200, shot 2026-09-05 17:34. Small glossy elliptic evergreen leaves in **opposite pairs** on pale squarish stems, the whole frame foliage in low sun — no flowers, and there would not be in September (box flowers are tiny and yellow-green in April; the card's Jan–Dec peak is evergreen interest, not bloom). **The opposite leaves are the check that matters on this bench**: the deck's *Ilex crenata* 'Jenny' and 'Kinme' are the box-blight substitutes sold on the same tables looking the same at arm's length, and *Ilex* leaves are alternate with a faintly crenate edge — this frame is not one of those. [Inference] Species rather than a cultivar is filed on Oscar's own statement ("seems like original variety"), the rosemary precedent: leaf size and the elongate shape are consistent with the straight species and against the dwarf 'Suffruticosa' or a round-leaved clone, but no foliage macro can settle a box cultivar on its own. No C2PA/JUMBF manifest in the file — a plain camera JPEG. **First and only *Buxus*** in the deck |
| Lagerstroemia indica WITH LOVE BABE ('Milaperl') | lagerstroemia-indica-with-love-babe-milaperl.jpg | 50% 40% default — **a four-panel COLLAGE kept whole** under the one-rule (v14.57): three small panels across the top (crinkled pink flowers · glossy opposite leaves · round ridged seed capsules) over one large frame carrying all three at once. 2160x3840, no EXIF orientation tag, staged 1200x2133 at 0.563 — narrower than the 0.75 gate, and left so: the deck already carries 30-odd masters below 0.75, and trimming a quarter of the height would cut a panel. On the card all four panels are legible and the top-left flowers clear the plaque. [Inference] *Lagerstroemia* is safe on the crinkled crepe petals, opposite entire leaves and the capsules; the trade name is Oscar's label, unverified. **First *Lagerstroemia*** in the deck |
| Astilbe 'Chocolate Shogun' | astilbe-chocolate-shogun.jpg | 50% 40% default — **two-frame side-by-side composite kept whole**, seam at x≈0.565: a backlit chocolate-bronze doubly-serrate leaf on a red stem left, the whole dark clump right, a spent plume at far left. 2994x3990, orientation 1, exactly 0.750. [Inference] Astilbe on the foliage and the dead plume; the cultivar is the dark leaf plus Oscar's label. **The held *Astilbe* 'Fanal' is a different card** — green leaves, red plumes — and the two must not swap. **First dealt *Astilbe*** |
| Cordyline australis 'Torbay Dazzler' | cordyline-australis-torbay-dazzler.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame looking straight down into the crown, EXIF orientation 6 baked by the staging decoder (sensor 4000x3000 → 3000x4000 at 0.750), 1200x1600. Cream-margined sword leaves radiating from centre-right; the crown centre sits mid-card and the striping is the whole identification. **Second *Cordyline***: CHARLIE BOY is the pink-and-bronze striped one, this is cream-and-green, told apart at a glance |
| Parthenocissus tricuspidata 'Lowii' | parthenocissus-tricuspidata-lowii.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame, 3000x3392 at 0.884, 1200x1357. Small deeply three-lobed leaves in wine-red autumn colour filling the top band, a nursery pot soft below the plaque. [Inference] 'Lowii' on the leaf size — the small crinkled deeply-cut leaf is what separates it from the plain species — and on Oscar's label. **The deck HOLDS the plain *Parthenocissus tricuspidata*** with no photo; this photograph is NOT that card's, and a future species photo must show the large glossy leaf. Also distinct from the dealt *P. quinquefolia* (five leaflets) |
| Picea glauca 'Echiniformis' | picea-glauca-echiniformis.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame, orientation 6 baked, 3000x4000 at 0.750, restaged 1200x1600. Short stiff grey-green needles on a brown shoot with resinous buds, one shoot sharp against the rest of the cushion soft. [Inference] *Picea* on the peg-mounted needles and the buds; **the cultivar is not visible in a needle macro** — 'Echiniformis' is told by HABIT (a squat dense mound) and this frame shows no habit. Filed on Oscar's label, the rosemary footing. **First *Picea*** in the deck |
| Araucaria araucana | araucaria-araucana.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame, orientation 6 baked, 3000x4000 at 0.750, restaged 1200x1600. One growing tip filling the left of the frame, the spirally-set rigid triangular leaves with their yellow spine tips unmistakable; more young plants soft behind on the nursery bench. **Nothing in the deck can be confused with it.** **First *Araucaria*** |
| Drosera capensis | drosera-capensis.jpg | 50% 40% default — **three-panel vertical COLLAGE kept whole** under the one-rule (v14.57): 2160x3840, no EXIF orientation tag, restaged 1200x2133 at 0.563, below the aspect gate on the same precedent as the Lagerstroemia. Strap-shaped leaves carrying the red glandular hairs and their dew drops, a trapped fly on the centre leaf — the whole identification in one picture. On the card the centre panel fills the band and the two side panels read as flanks. **First carnivorous plant and first *Drosera*** |
| Ceanothus thyrsiflorus 'Cool Blue' | ceanothus-thyrsiflorus-cool-blue.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame, orientation 6 baked, 3000x4000 at 0.750, restaged 1200x1600. Small glossy leaves with a broad cream margin around a dark-green centre, on a green shoot, the variegated mass soft behind. No flowers in September and none expected — peak is Apr–Jun. [Inference] the variegation is the whole cultivar claim and it is plainly there; the species assignment is Oscar's label. **Second *Ceanothus*** — 'Concha' is plain dark green, no confusion |
| Hydrangea quercifolia 'Ice Crystal' | hydrangea-quercifolia-ice-crystal.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame, orientation 6 baked, 3000x4000 at 0.750, restaged 1200x1600. Deeply cut oak-like leaves filling the frame, a few turning red and purple at the edges in early September. [Inference] *H. quercifolia* is safe on the leaf; the cultivar is Oscar's label — 'Ice Crystal' is distinguished by its more deeply dissected leaf and compact habit, and the leaf here is deeply dissected, which is consistent but not proof. **Fourth hydrangea species in the deck** (*macrophylla*, *arborescens*, *serrata*, *aspera* already there); no other oak-leaf, so no bench confusion |
| Acer palmatum 'Taylor' | acer-palmatum-taylor.jpg | 50% 40% default — **three-panel vertical COLLAGE kept whole**: 2160x3840, no EXIF orientation tag, restaged 1200x2133 at 0.563. Hot-pink new growth over the mature palmate leaves with their pink-cream margins — the plant's two states in one frame, which is the reason to keep both. [Inference] the pink-margined variegation is consistent with 'Taylor' and with 'Butterfly'-type clones; filed on Oscar's label. **Sixth *Acer palmatum*** — the other five are plain green, red or coral-barked, none variegated pink |
| Hydrangea paniculata 'Pink & Rose' | hydrangea-paniculata-pink-rose.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped on Oscar's instruction** (*"don't crop this hydrangea photo"*), orientation 1, 3000x3880 at 0.773, staged 1200x1552. One cream panicle filling the centre, the four-sepal sterile florets sharp, a red-stemmed toothed leaf arching over it, blue sky top-left. [Inference] *H. paniculata* on the conical panicle and the toothed ovate leaf on a red petiole; the cultivar is Oscar's label, and his own JSON note says the supplied label text read *'Pink and Ros'*, so the name wants checking against the pot. **Second *H. paniculata*** after 'Wim's Red', which is the one that goes deep red — this one is cream now and pinks later, so the two are told apart by September colour |
| Begonia soli-mutata | begonia-soli-mutata.jpg | 50% 40% default — **kept whole**: Oscar allowed *"very light"* cropping if it helped, the render said it did not — the white flower cluster sits mid-band with the puckered dark-green leaf and its red margin behind, and nothing is under the furniture. EXIF orientation 6 baked (sensor 4000x3000 → 3000x4000), 1200x1600. [Inference] the pebbled leaf surface, pale-veined and red-edged, with a loose cyme of small white four-tepal flowers is consistent with *B. soli-mutata*; species filed on Oscar's label. **Second *Begonia*** — BONFIRE ('Nzcone') is an orange-flowered tuberous type and looks nothing like this. **First H1c card** on the deck's own data |
| Albizia julibrissin 'Summer Chocolate' | albizia-julibrissin-summer-chocolate.jpg | 50% 40% default — single frame shot up into the canopy against white sky, EXIF orientation 6 baked (sensor 4000x3000 → 3000x4000), 1200x1600, kept whole. Bipinnate fronds in chocolate-bronze with the tiny paired leaflets sharp in the centre, more fronds soft behind. [Inference] *Albizia* is safe on the leaf; the chocolate colour is the whole cultivar claim and it is plainly there, but 'Summer Chocolate' is filed on Oscar's label, whose own JSON says the pot read only *'Albizia chocolate'*. **Second *Albizia***: the species card 'Persian Silk Tree' is green-leaved, so the two are told apart at a glance and must not swap. No flowers in September; the pink powder-puffs on the card are Jul–Aug |
| Helleborus × ericsmithii 'Winter Moonbeam' | helleborus-ericsmithii-winter-moonbeam.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, verdict as-is. Silver-veined dark foliage; no flowers, and there would not be in August — peak is Dec–Apr, so the white-ageing-pink blooms the card names want a winter reshoot. **The strongest provenance in the deck this month**: a full signed Galaxy S24 *capture* manifest (JUMBF, `c2pa.ingredient.v2`, `relationship parentOf`) with no `digitalSourceType` and no Photo assist marker — the untouched-original signature, which almost nothing else in the recent batch carries. **Second hellebore**, but 'Anna's Red' is still held and has no photo, so no bench confusion yet |
| Oenothera stricta 'Sulphurea' | oenothera-stricta-sulphurea.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, verdict as-is. Another of Oscar's deliberate composites: the open flower filling the frame, caught at the peach stage it fades to, with a labelled `foliage` inset panel he added across the top-right for the bronzy-green leaves and red stems. The arithmetic said the card's top furniture would slice that panel and leave a stray label; the render says otherwise — half the panel and the whole label survive inside the band and read as an inset, not a remnant. Measured, not assumed, and left whole under v14.34. **Third *Oenothera***, and the only *stricta*: the other two are *O. lindheimeri* (GAUDI ROSE and 'Rosy Jane'), white-to-pink four-petal gaura flowers on wiry stems — this one is a lemon-to-peach bowl on a low bronzed mound, so the confusion is in the genus name only |
| Monstera deliciosa 'Thai Constellation' | monstera-deliciosa-thai-constellation.jpg | 50% 40% default — **Oscar's own PNG cutout on flat black**, 1502x2002, exactly 0.750, no EXIF because it is a PNG export. Kept as supplied: the black ground is his choice and the cream-splashed leaves are the whole identification. **Second *Monstera*** after the plain species — variegation is the only visible difference |
| Coronilla emerus | coronilla-emerus.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, 0.750. Small rounded pinnate leaflets in soft focus behind; no flowers in September. Label read as 'colitrna' by Oscar; the accepted name is *Hippocrepis emerus*, recorded as a synonym, and the label name kept as the card name |
| Malus 'Veitch’s Scarlet' | malus-veitch-s-scarlet.jpg | 50% 40% default — **7% trimmed off the top edge only**: 2790x4000 is 0.698, under the gate. Ripening scarlet-purple crab apples hanging under bronze-flushed leaves, Oscar's hand and the bamboo cane left in as scale. **Third *Malus*** after 'John Downie' (dealt) and 'Evereste' (held) |
| Cupressus macrocarpa 'Goldcrest' | cupressus-macrocarpa-goldcrest.jpg | 50% 40% default — Oscar's own tall crop at **0.422**, which would have shown a quarter of itself on the 16:10 detail sheet; cut to a 0.75 window from 20% to 76% down. Uniform sunlit golden foliage with the sky gap kept — nothing identifying was in the discarded strips |
| Cedrus deodara | cedrus-deodara.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, 0.750. Soft needle clusters on a long horizontal branch, new growth lit yellow-green. **Second *Cedrus***: the atlas 'Horstmann’s Silberspitz' is blue with cream tips, this is green with a drooping habit |
| Nemesia 'Confetti' | nemesia-confetti.jpg | 50% 40% default — **another of Oscar's labelled composites**, kept whole: massed lilac flowers with a white-outlined `foliage` cutout pasted mid-right. Sits lower in the frame than the Oenothera's corner inset, so it lands well inside the card band |
| Modiolastrum lateritium | modiolastrum-lateritium.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, 0.750. Lobed, scalloped, red-rimmed leaves in hard sun; no flower. The name is Oscar's reading of an unclear label ('m-something') and the supplied habit data disagrees with what usually carries this name — see VQ 66 before trusting the card |
| Juniperus virginiana 'Blue Arrow' | juniperus-virginiana-blue-arrow.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, 0.750. Blue-green scale foliage along brown side branches, sky behind. Oscar assigned it as photo 9; the same note says juniper photos are coming, so this may be replaced — a one-command restage if so |
| *(parked)* Physocarpus, cultivar unknown | physocarpus-opulifolius-dark-unidentified.jpg | **NOT ON A CARD.** One Physocarpus photograph arrived with two Physocarpus cards ('All Black' and LITTLE DEVIL 'Minall2'); the pot label in the top-right corner is blurred beyond reading. Both cards are held and the photo is staged under a descriptive name — the Vitex precedent (VQ 58). VQ 60 |
| Robinia pseudoacacia 'Lace Lady' | robinia-pseudoacacia-lace-lady.jpg | 50% 40% default — **Oscar's labelled composite, kept whole**: pinnate leaves over a zig-zagging brown stem, with a `thorned stem` inset panel top-right showing the paired purple spines. 2594x3624 is 0.716, under the gate, so **4.6% trimmed off the bottom edge only** — trimming the top would have pushed the inset up into the furniture. EXIF 2026-08-26. Photo assigned by Oscar ("robinas photo"). One thing to look at on the bench: the card's own visual line leads on *curly* leaflets, and the leaflets in this frame lie flat — see VQ 64 |
| Prunus incisa 'Kojo-no-mai' | prunus-incisa-kojo-no-mai.jpg — **REPLACED 2026-09-02** | 50% 40% default — **swapped at Oscar's request** ("better photo"). Old photo (Aug 2026 original add) showed the shoot propped against a weathered fence rail, half the frame taken up by wood grain. New photo is another of Oscar's PNG cutouts on flat black, 2998x3998, exactly 0.750, no crop needed — denser foliage, sharper serration detail, his hand and secateurs at the base for scale. Old master kept nowhere else; the file was overwritten in place, so the swap is provenance-only, recorded here and in CREDITS |
| Impatiens omeiana | impatiens-omeiana.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, 3000x4000 at 0.750. **Flagged before dealing, dealt anyway on Oscar's direct confirmation.** The card's own text describes a soft herbaceous woodland balsam — elongated leaves, silver veins, yellow flowers. The photograph shows glossy, spine-toothed, leathery leaves on woody red stems, closer to an *Osmanthus* or holly than anything herbaceous, and nothing in the frame is a flower. I asked Oscar directly, against this photo, whether the identification was right; he confirmed it. Dealt as supplied, both my doubt and his confirmation on record in the card's `uncertain` list and here — this is his call, made after seeing exactly what I saw |
| Exochorda × macrantha ('The Bride') | exochorda-macrantha.jpg **+ PHOTO_SWAP** | 50% 40% default — **a two-frame card, sent as a pair by Oscar with the swap asked for by name.** Primary: whorled oblong pale-green leaves on a dark stem, rain-wet, uncropped at 0.781 — the plant as it stands on the bench in August. Alt (`-fruit.jpg`, focus 50% 45%): the ribbed russet seed capsule that is the genus's signature; EXIF orientation 6 baked upright to 3000x4000, otherwise untouched. 22 seconds apart (15:16:27 / 15:16:49), same plant, same rain. Neither frame has the April–May white flowers the card sells, and the card says so in `uncertain`. **Supplied latin is the bare hybrid**, while common and `cvs` both name 'The Bride' — kept as supplied, not renamed (VQ 60). The JSON arrived in prose where the deck uses ` · ` lists and `Mon-Mon` peaks; normalised to house format with no fact changed — soil types + pH collapsed to "Any, well-drained" with the waterlogging warning kept |

| Anisodontea capensis 'Ib201-7' (CARNIVAL LIGHTS CANDY APPLE) | anisodontea-capensis-ib201-7.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, orientation already 1, portrait 3000x3444 at 0.871 (inside the gate, the Styrax precedent). One large deep-red flower with the crimson veining and dark stamens top-right, a lobed grey-green mallow leaf sharp at left — flower AND foliage in one frame, both halves of the card's own visual line. Current-season Galaxy S24 capture, shot the day it was staged. **First *Anisodontea* in the deck**, no confusion risk |

| Cyclamen hederifolium var. hederifolium f. albiflorum | cyclamen-hederifolium-var-hederifolium-f-albiflorum.jpg | 50% 40% default — **cropped for arithmetic, not taste**: source 1960x3732 at 0.525, far below the 0.75 gate, with the bottom ~30% being the plastic tray rim and its sandy face. Full-width crop of the top 70% through `reframe-photo.js` lands at 1960x2612, exactly 0.750; the white reflexed flower on its coral stem and the silver-marbled ivy-shaped hero leaf — both halves of the card's visual line — sit in the card band. Clean Galaxy S24 EXIF, no C2PA/AI marker. **First *Cyclamen* in the deck.** Peak Sep–Nov and shot in late August with the first flowers just opening, so the frame matches the card's own season |

| Phygelius aequalis 'Trewidden Pink' | phygelius-aequalis-trewidden-pink.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, EXIF orientation 6 (sensor 4000x3000, displays portrait 3000x4000 at exactly 0.750), rotation baked in at `verdict: as-is`, the Erigeron/Vitex precedent. Pendent tubular flowers upper-left, the serrate opposite hero leaf upper-right — genus-confirming. **Assigned against the send order**: the JSON array led with the Dahlia but this frame is unmistakably the Phygelius; matched on the plant, the Vitex rule. ⚠ [flag] **The card says "dusky-pink" and the photograph reads coral-RED in hard sun** — the tubes have pale throats and red-rimmed lobes. Consistent with a phone camera saturating a coral-pink cultivar in full August light (the Agapanthus precedent), but the cultivar is not verifiable from this frame; if a softer-light frame ever shows true red, the ID wants Oscar's eye. **First *Phygelius* in the deck** |
| Dahlia 'Kelvin Floodlight' | dahlia-kelvin-floodlight.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, orientation 1, portrait 3000x4000 at exactly 0.750. The huge butter-yellow decorative bloom fills the right of the frame with the dark pinnate foliage left — cultivar-consistent: 'Kelvin Floodlight' is THE giant yellow decorative, and nothing else in the deck looks like it. Leaves show pale mottled spotting, true to a bench dahlia in late August. **Second *Dahlia*** — ELECTRO PINK is a neon cactus type, no confusion risk |

| Solanum pyracanthos | solanum-pyracanthos.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped by us** (2482x3024 at 0.821, orientation 1), but **the file carries Oscar's own sticker edit, the Salvia 'Black and Blue' class, and this time the C2PA manifest says so precisely**: a Samsung PhotoEditor deco re-edit declaring a crop to 91% height, a filter, and ONE non-text sticker at centre (0.215, 0.235), ~23% wide, rotated -10° — which is exactly where the purple flower sits. **No generative action**: no `Photo assist` agent, no trained-media source type, `isScaleAI:false`, AI filter false, no visible label. The pasted flower is species-correct (purple 5-lobed star, yellow poricidal anther cone) and every other ID feature — grey-green lobed leaves, vivid orange spines on stems, midribs AND calyx, a developing fruit — is the camera's own capture. Two blurred nursery labels lower-left (one reads "SOL…", the right genus) fall below the card band, the Sempervivum precedent. **Second *Solanum*** — *S. laxum* 'Album' is a white-flowered climber, no confusion risk. No red fruits in frame: an autumn reshoot would complete the card's own visual line |
| Persicaria affinis 'Darjeeling Red' | persicaria-affinis-darjeeling-red.jpg | 50% 40% default — **uncropped**, a clean Galaxy S24 capture (EXIF 2026-08-29 11:32:14, no C2PA), 3000×4000 staged at 1200×1600. One dense pink-white spike going over, browning at the base, above the mat of lanceolate leaves with the ochrea visible at the stem node — *Persicaria affinis* by the spike, the mat and the sheath. Late-season, so the "maturing deep red" the card promises is not in this frame; the cultivar is Oscar's label, not the photograph's. **New genus** for the deck. Its 39-character soil value renders at three lines of shrunk type in the soil panel; kept as researched (VERIFY-QUEUE 67) |
| Veronicastrum 'Red Arrows' | veronicastrum-red-arrows.jpg | **50% 0%** — pinned to the top so the frame's **visible "AI-generated content" label**, bottom-left of the source, falls outside the window; the master is 1200×1568 (0.765), so ~9% of height is available and the label sits inside it. Verified on the rendered card. Framing, not concealment: the marker is written verbatim into `CREDITS.json`. Credentials differ from the Houttuynia pattern — a C2PA manifest with `c2pa.ingredient.v2` and claim generator `Galaxy S24 c2pa-rs/0.62.0`, **no** `digitalSourceType` string found, but no camera EXIF, a non-native 2948×3852 frame and the burned-in label, i.e. an edited export of a capture titled `20260829_113205(1).jpg`. Whorled red-edged lanceolate leaves under a violet spike — the plant on the card. **New genus** |
| Viburnum opulus ('Compactum') | viburnum-opulus.jpg | 50% 40% default — **named by Oscar** (*"1st image is the viburnum"*) and the frame agrees: palmately lobed, toothed leaves with a cluster of glossy red berries top-of-frame, the card's own visual line. Cropped export at 3000×2626 (landscape, no camera EXIF, no C2PA), so the window keeps only part of the width; the berries sit in the top band under the title. **Card latin is the species as supplied**, with 'Compactum' in `cvs`; the deck's other guelder rose is the sterile 'Roseum' (held), a different plant. `hue` and `peak` were prose as sent and were converted with a labelled note (VERIFY-QUEUE 69) |
| Ceratostigma willmottianum SAPPHIRE RING ('Lissbrill') | ceratostigma-willmottianum-sapphire-ring-lissbrill.jpg **+ PHOTO_SWAP** (added 2026-09-02) | swap alt `-flowers.jpg`, 50% 50%, 3.5s hold — **Oscar's ask**: *"flash between the current card photo and this photo as it has a flower"*. The card photo is the gold, red-edged hairy foliage with no bloom; the new frame (Galaxy S24, 2026-08-31 15:54, clean) is the same foliage with the cobalt flowers the card is named for. Fifth swap card; the deck's first added at the owner's request rather than from a spare sweep. Verified rendering both frames |
| Ilex crenata 'Kinme' | ilex-crenata-kinme.jpg | 50% 40% default — **REPLACED 2026-09-02** at Oscar's request: *"we tried to cut out, the cut out version I uploaded sucked, this is much better"*. The earlier master was a black-background cutout of this exact sprig (same leaves, same green fruit); the new one is the uncut frame, 1440×2216, sprig top-left over blurred concrete. No camera EXIF, no C2PA |
| Trachelospermum jasminoides | trachelospermum-jasminoides.jpg | **30% 45%** (was 40% 45%) — **REPLACED 2026-09-02** at Oscar's request: *"it was not aligned correctly"*. Same shot, wider frame: the earlier master was a tight portrait crop of this 2612×2562 near-square. At 1.02 the window keeps ~82% of the width, so the focus moved left to hold the flower truss (x ≈ 10–55%) with the glossy leaves top-right. No camera EXIF, no C2PA |
| Caryopteris × clandonensis ('Dark Knight') | caryopteris-clandonensis.jpg | 50% 40% default — **dealt 2026-09-06 on Oscar's resend** (*"here is that photo dark knight"*), the Pinus mugo route. Gold foliage, silver-grey stems, deep blue-violet flower clusters top-right and bottom, 3000×4000 clean. The first frame of the same plant, parked as `caryopteris-gold-flowering-unconfirmed.jpg`, is retired. **The card's visual line says grey-green and the picture is gold** — VERIFY-QUEUE 69 has the ask |

## 5. Decision changelog

- **Merge note, 2026-09-06.** The card-build branch and the live line both
  numbered their changelog entries v14.48 upward on the same day. On merge the
  card-build entries (Common Box through the Viburnum removal) were renumbered
  v14.52–v14.59, and the live line's v14.48–v14.51 kept their numbers. Commit
  messages on the card-build branch still say the old numbers; this note is
  the key.

- **v14.62 (496 dealt / 75 held — PHOTO CAPTION: a one-line tag on the photograph)**:
  Oscar, 2026-10-04, sending his Amsonia 'Blue Ice' photo: *"the amsonia needs like a
  little label at the bottom saying autumnal colour"*. The photograph is the plant in its
  gold autumn foliage; the card is named for periwinkle-blue stars in May-Jun and its
  `visual` names both, but nothing on the front said which one the picture shows. The
  same gap exists on every card whose photo is one season or one feature of a plant the
  card describes in more than one (the flash-between cards show their frames in turn and
  never say what each is).

  **What was added.** A text registry `PHOTO_CAPTION`, keyed by latin-slug exactly like
  `PHOTO_FOCUS`, and one element: `captionHTML(slug)` emits `<div class="pcap">…</div>`
  after the PLANT POWER POINTS line only when the slug has an entry, with `& < > "`
  escaped. `.pcap` is a small italic Georgia tag (9px, cream `#f2e8c8`) on a dark pill
  (`rgba(8,18,10,.72)`, 1px `rgba(236,215,160,.45)` border, 9px radius) at `left:15.14%`
  (the plaque's left edge) and `top:54.3%`, so its bottom edge sits at about 57% with the
  PLANT POWER POINTS lettering at 58.28% below it; `max-width:60%`, one line,
  ellipsis, `pointer-events:none`, z-index 4 with the lettering. Italic lower-case on a
  pill so it reads as a caption and not as a second line of the gold small-caps strip.
  Every card without an entry is byte-for-byte what it was.

  **Checks.** `PHOTO_CAPTION` is in `tools/check-boot.js` REGISTRIES, so a key that is
  not a current card's slug fails the fast set like a stray `PHOTO_FOCUS` key. The nine
  locked anchors are untouched (`template-geometry --check` green); `audit-layout`,
  `verify-cards`, `deck-audit` and `perf-test` green on the build; the full sequential
  gate run on the pushed head. Rendered at 390x780 2x: the tag clears the growth rail
  (its right edge stops well short of 78%) and the HEIGHT rail value (whose box ends at
  53.9% on the left spine, a different column). First and only entry: `amsonia-blue-ice`
  → "Autumnal colour", Oscar's words. Record: `data/held-photos/2026-10-03/README.md`.

- **v14.61 (348 dealt / 84 held — THE CARD'S PAINTED FURNITURE BECOMES CSS,
  and the deck stops building 13,546 images)**: no visual change at all — this
  is the same card, drawn the same way, costing a fraction of what it cost.

  **What was wrong.** Every card wore its shared artwork as `<img>` elements:
  the parchment plaque, the soil panel, the aspect band, the hardiness crest,
  the two spine patches, the sun pip, the growth diamond, and fifteen rating
  widgets built from an outline image and a wider fill image clipped by a
  wrapper span. That is **38 image elements per card for 15 distinct files**.
  Measured on the live deck at 348 cards, 390x844 @2x:

  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<img>` elements in the document | 13,546 | 360 |
  | DOM nodes | 68,593 | 50,895 |
  | deck settled (wall clock) | 3,820 ms | 1,689 ms |
  | first contentful paint | 640 ms | 372 ms |

  345 of the 348 cards carried a byte-identical set of those 38 images. The
  artwork was never per-card; only the photograph is.

  **Why it mattered.** `DECK_CAP` in `timber.html` records the reason light mode
  exists: two different iPhones hit Safari's *"A problem repeatedly occurred"* on
  the full deck, and the note beside it measured the cost at **~326 MB of
  renderer memory with 168 cards, 31k nodes and 6.3k `<img>`**. The deck has
  since more than doubled — 68.6k nodes and 13.5k `<img>` when this change
  started — so the app was travelling toward that ceiling, not away from it.
  [Unverified] whether this stops the iPhone kill; no WebKit engine exists in
  the build environment and that has not changed. What IS verified is that the
  thing the note blamed — size — is now a quarter of what it was on the axis
  that grew fastest.

  **What was built.** The artwork moved into the stylesheet, which is what
  `.wisp` has always done (`<i>` + `background-image`), so this follows an
  existing convention rather than inventing one:

  - **Rating icons.** `.ricon` is one span. The outline is its background and
    sets the box via `aspect-ratio` (the in-flow `<img>` used to do that); the
    fill is `::after`, whose width does the clipping `.fillwrap`'s `overflow`
    did. The two halves are NOT the same shape — the fill is a wider drawing —
    so `background-size:auto 100%` reproduces the original exactly: drop
    33x50 out against 35x50 fill, seca 39x103 / 42x104, spray 42x80 / 42x82.
    Four elements became one, fifteen times per card.
  - **Plaque, soil panel, band.** Painted on `::before`, **not** on the element.
    `.tcard.edition` gives `.plaque` and `.soilp` a `border-radius`, and a
    border-radius **clips a background** while it never clipped the in-flow
    `<img>` — putting the art on the element itself would have quietly rounded
    the panel corners on every edition card. A `::before` is a child box, so
    they keep the square corners they have always had. A holo card writes its
    own artwork into `--panel-art`; the `art/holo/` overrides are byte-for-byte
    the same three shapes (700x446, 172x344, 900x118), so one `aspect-ratio`
    serves both.
  - **Crest, spine patches, sun pip, growth diamond.** Straight backgrounds.
    `.railval` keeps its background on the element because
    `.tcard.holo .railval::before` already owns that pseudo-element; the holo
    rule that hid the green parchment patch is now `background-image:none`.

  **How it was checked, and what the check actually found.** All **348 cards were
  screenshotted before and after** and compared pixel by pixel, using the app's
  own `cutUnder()` to bring each card to the top so the deck state at capture N is
  identical between runs, with animations frozen.

  **It is not bit-identical, and that is worth stating plainly rather than
  rounding to "no visual change".** 347 of 348 cards differ. The differences are:

  - **confined to the rating widgets.** Nothing else on the card moved a pixel —
    not the plaque, the crest, the band, the soil panel, the spine patches or the
    growth diamond. Those came out byte-identical, which is what the `::before`
    and `aspect-ratio` work above was for.
  - **not geometry.** Every `.ricon` was measured before and after: x, width,
    height and `--fill` agree to three decimal places on all fifteen icons, in all
    three rows, on the card and in the press-and-hold lens.
  - **0.43% of the card's pixels**, mean delta 38, tracing the anti-aliased
    OUTLINES of the line art. At 10x zoom on the half-filled drop — the most
    information-bearing icon on the card, because its fill boundary is the
    reading — the two are the same drop, same outline weight, same boundary in
    the same place.

  The cause is the paint path, not the layout: the card carries a NON-UNIFORM
  transform (measured sx 0.890, sy 0.997), and a 33x50 master resampled into a
  ~10.6 x 18 px box lands its edge pixels slightly differently as a background
  than as an `<img>`. [Unverified] as to Chromium's exact filtering difference —
  what is established is that the boxes are identical and that
  `background-size:100% 100%` and `auto 100%` give byte-identical output, so the
  residual is not a sizing choice that could be tuned away.

  **The trade, stated once:** sub-perceptual re-rasterisation of the shared icon
  artwork, against 13,186 fewer image elements and a deck that settles in 1.7s
  instead of 3.8s. Worth it on the evidence — but it is an aesthetic call on
  Oscar's own artwork, so the crops are in the session, not just the numbers.

  A new `perf-test` check locks the structure in: **no `<img>` under `art/` may
  appear outside a card's photo frame** (the documented `.pesticon` opt-in aside),
  and every `<img>` a card owns must be its photograph. That check exists because
  the regression is invisible — adding an `<img>` back to `renderCard` renders
  identically and costs nothing until the deck is a few hundred cards deep on a
  phone.

  `tools/build-standalone.js` needed no change: its art regex already matched
  `art/<name>.<ext>` tokens "in CSS and JS alike".

  **Deliberately NOT changed: `design/card-builder.html`.** It keeps its own copy
  of the old `<img>`-based `.ricon` markup. That is a design mock rendered from
  `file://` against the `../art/*.png` MASTERS, where the app loads the `.webp`
  derivatives — the two were never meant to be byte-identical, and the builder
  exists to check rating maths (`design/verify-cards.js` reads `--fill` off
  `.ricon`, which is unchanged). Noting it so the divergence is a decision on the
  record rather than something missed: if the widget rendering is ever reworked
  again, both copies need the pass.

  **What this change gave away, and how it is guarded.** An `<img>` derives its
  own height from the file. A background does not, so the shape of eight art
  masters is now hardcoded in `timber.html` as `aspect-ratio`. Re-crop one of
  those masters and the layout no longer moves — the artwork STRETCHES inside a
  box that is still the old shape, on every card, silently. `optimise-art.js
  --check` now maps each of those eight ratios back to the master it came from
  and fails if they disagree, reading the PNG's IHDR header directly so it needs
  no image library.

  Fixing that check meant fixing the check itself first. `optimise-art --check`
  was **passing without running**: it did `process.exit(0)` the moment
  `require('sharp')` threw, and sharp is not installed on any machine that runs
  the gate here, so `tests/run-all.js` printed *"every art master has a current
  .webp derivative"* while proving nothing — including through every deploy.
  Its check path is pure `fs` and never needed sharp. This is the twin of the
  `optimise-photos` bug that shipped five blank cards, recorded on 2026-09-15 and
  now fixed the same way: sharp is loaded only for the encode path. Proved by
  deleting `art/crest-blank.webp` and watching the gate fail where it used to
  pass, and by rewriting one `aspect-ratio` and watching the shape guard catch it.

- **v14.60 (288 dealt / 86 held — TOXICITY FLAG on the front, and a
  press-and-hold to read it)**: Oscar's spec, 2026-09-13: *"a minimalist banner
  that shows it's toxic, maybe on front of card just a red corner triangle left
  corner… then a hold down on that image that pops up like the hardiness hold
  down, and says briefly what part of the plant is toxic or how it's toxic or
  what to watch out for."*
  **What was built.** A corner-fold triangle flush in the top-left of the frame,
  legs 8.6% × 6% of the template (36 × 36 px), stopping short of the painted
  rosette that starts ~5% in; a small "!" in its fold. Press-and-hold on it
  (the same `LENS_HOLD` gesture as the crest, same `openLens` path, new kind
  `'tox'`) raises a three-row lens: *Safety · <tier>* / *Watch for* / *Also on
  the back of this card, under Safety*. Release closes it, as with the others.
  **The rule that decides who gets a flag is the back's rule, not a new one.**
  `toxFlag()` runs the prose through the same `toxTier()` ladder the SAFETY
  plaque uses, and only the three hazard tiers get a flag — severe (red
  `#ef5f5f`), harmful (orange `#f08a3c`), caution (amber `#f5c451`), the
  plaque's own inks. The other two tiers get none: an *edibility* note
  ("ripe berries are edible", 6 cards) or a sourced *all-clear* (1 card)
  must not put a coloured corner on a shop card, because a coloured corner
  reads as a hazard and a green one reads as "safe to eat" — neither of which
  the field claims. Blank stays blank: 322 cards carry no note, and they get
  nothing, because *not recorded* is not *safe*. Oscar asked for red; the tier
  ink is used instead so the front can never shout what the back would not.
  **Count today: 45 cards flag** (5 severe, 37 harmful, 3 caution) out of 374.
  Verified by rendering one card per tier plus one edible and one blank:
  presence, absence, position (0 / 0 / 8.6%), hold-opens, release-closes, no
  page errors. Nothing checked by `audit-layout` (`.val-ink`, title, latin,
  band, plaque, growth) is touched; a semantic diff of all 374 cards shows zero
  field changes — this is code only.
  **The 322 blanks are the real work, and a brief now exists for them:**
  `CHATGPT-TOXICITY-BRIEF.md`, with the list to paste at
  `data/incoming/toxicity-todo-2026-09-13.txt`. The brief is written against
  the ladder above so what comes back tiers the way the card expects, and it
  refuses hedges: a blank is always better than "may be harmful".

- **v14.59 (276 dealt / 82 held — a duplicate Viburnum removed on Oscar's
  call)**: the deck carried *Viburnum* × *bodnantense* (the plain "Bodnant
  Viburnum") beside *V.* × *bodnantense* 'Charles Lamont', and both cards wore
  the same photograph — the species card the wider frame, 'Charles Lamont' a
  tighter crop of the same shoot. Oscar: *"the charles lamont is perfect,
  simply remove the other card with the same photo from the deck."* Removed.
  - The wider frame is kept as the spare
    `viburnum-bodnantense-charles-lamont-wide.jpg`, renamed so its filename
    says what it is, with the history in its credit. The stale CREDITS entry
    and WebP derivative for the old slug are gone.
  - Nothing else referenced the card: no focus override, no photo swap, no
    test literal. The counting suites derive the deck size from the file.
  - **The first card removed from the deck since the hold block existed.**
    There is no tool for it; the row was lifted by the same regex
    `deal-plant.js` uses and the deck re-parsed to exactly one fewer before
    the file was written.

- **v14.58 (277 dealt / 82 held — Silk Tree 'Summer Chocolate')**: dealt from
  Oscar's frame, whole. The green species card was already in the deck; this
  is the chocolate-leaved cultivar beside it. Oscar's JSON records that the
  label read only *'Albizia chocolate'* and the cultivar is his reading of it.
  JSON converted on the v14.54 pattern, changes logged in `uncertain`; ratings
  and hardiness his, not re-verified.

- **v14.57 (276 dealt / 82 held — two new cards, and the Carolina Sweetheart
  collage restored)**: Oscar's message names all three jobs and the rule for
  them: *"don't crop."*
  - **Cercis canadensis CAROLINA SWEETHEART**: the three-panel collage that
    v14.15-era staging cut down to one panel is the master again, whole. The
    single-panel reasoning (*"a card window cannot render a collage without a
    seam"*) was retired by v14.53 and this is its last survivor put right. The
    old panel stays as a spare file.
  - **Hydrangea paniculata 'Pink & Rose'** dealt uncropped as instructed.
    Oscar's own JSON flags that the supplied label read *'Pink and Ros'*; the
    cultivar name is carried as he wrote it and marked for a check.
  - **Begonia soli-mutata** dealt whole: he allowed a very light crop, the
    render showed nothing to fix, so nothing was cut. The supplied `cvs` of
    *'Soli-Mutata'* is the species epithet, not a cultivar, and is left blank
    on the card rather than printed as one — logged in the JSON.
  - Both JSONs converted to the card schema on the v14.54 pattern, every
    change written into `uncertain`; ratings, hardiness and text are Oscar's,
    not re-verified.

- **v14.56 (VQ 49 closes on a field observation)**: Oscar on the Rhodanthemum:
  *"that rhodanthemum actually throws out yellow and white flowers, this is
  one of its white ones."* The name 'Zagora Yellow' stands; the photograph is
  a white bloom from a plant that carries both. The card's `visual` now reads
  *"Yellow daisies, some opening white"* so the face agrees with the picture
  a customer is looking at. [Unverified] beyond Oscar's own watching of the
  plant, and recorded as that. Both open Rhodanthemum questions (57, 59, 49)
  are now closed by the same person on the same day.

- **v14.55 (274 dealt / 82 held — the six parked cards from v14.54 dealt the
  same afternoon)**: Oscar's photographs for *Picea glauca* 'Echiniformis',
  *Araucaria araucana*, *Drosera capensis*, *Ceanothus thyrsiflorus* 'Cool
  Blue', *Hydrangea quercifolia* 'Ice Crystal' and *Acer palmatum* 'Taylor'
  arrived within the hour, and `deal-plant.js` took each in one command — the
  park-then-deal route working exactly as designed.
  - Four single frames, all orientation 6 baked and restaged at 1200x1600; two
    three-panel collages (Drosera, Acer) kept whole at 0.563 on the v14.54
    precedent.
  - **Genus is proved by every frame; cultivar by none of them.** A needle
    macro cannot show a spruce's habit, a variegated leaf cannot name its
    clone. Each register row says which, and each is filed on Oscar's label.
  - "Pineapple" in the message is the phone's spelling of *Picea*; the
    photograph settles which it meant.

- **v14.54 (268 dealt / 88 held — Oscar's ten-card batch: four dealt, six
  parked)**: JSON for eleven plants and five photographs arrived together.
  - **Dealt with photographs**: *Lagerstroemia indica* WITH LOVE BABE
    ('Milaperl'), *Astilbe* 'Chocolate Shogun', *Cordyline australis* 'Torbay
    Dazzler', *Parthenocissus tricuspidata* 'Lowii'. Two of the four are
    composites and both are kept whole under v14.53 — the Lagerstroemia at
    0.563, below the aspect gate, on the precedent of the thirty-odd masters
    already there and because a height trim would cut a panel.
  - **Parked without photographs** (`PLANTS_ON_HOLD`, source JSON in
    `data/incoming/`): *Picea glauca* 'Echiniformis', *Hydrangea quercifolia*
    'Ice Crystal', *Ceanothus thyrsiflorus* 'Cool Blue', *Araucaria araucana*,
    *Drosera capensis*, *Acer palmatum* 'Taylor'. `deal-plant.js` takes each
    the moment a photo lands.
  - **One JSON refused as a duplicate**: *Buddleja davidii* LITTLE RUBY is
    already dealt (v14.19) with a photograph the register calls clean. Oscar's
    new Buddleja frame is kept aside, not swapped in — VQ 66.
  - **The batch JSON was not in the card schema**, and every conversion is
    written into each file's `uncertain` so it can be reversed: latin composed
    from genus + cultivar (the deck's trade-name convention for the
    Lagerstroemia); `hue` from a colour word to a number; aspect lists to the
    compass format; seasons to `Mon-Mon` ranges, each marked [Inference];
    `soil` / `soilWarning` cut to the measured 26 / 44 limits; foliage and
    container to the fixed vocabulary. **Ratings, hardiness, sizes and prose
    are Oscar's as supplied** and not re-verified — RHS is unreachable here.

- **v14.53 (264 dealt / 82 held — the Rhodanthemum gets its flower back, and
  the deck has one inset rule)**: Oscar's call on VQ 57, in his words: *"cropping
  ruined the rhodanthemum card, having the flower image in there is beneficial."*
  - **Restored whole.** The supplied picture-in-picture collage is the master
    again, trimmed only at the bottom (5.7%) to meet the 0.75 aspect gate — a
    real problem under v14.34, not a composition preference. The inset panel is
    untouched.
  - **The focus override earns its place for once.** The master is wider than
    the card window, so cover crops the sides, and the flower at the default
    50% X sat under the hardiness shield. `100% 40%` moves the window to the
    master's right edge: flower clear of the shield, inset flush with the
    corner. Measured on three rendered candidates, not reasoned — the Oenothera
    lesson (v14.34 / VQ 59) applied.
  - **VQ 59 resolves to ONE rule.** A deliberate two-part identification photo
    is kept whole, inset or side-by-side; whether it survives the furniture is
    settled by rendering it, and by a focus override where the master is wider
    than the window. The Rosa 'Summer Song' sticker (VQ 58) and this card no
    longer disagree.
  - **VQ 49 is now on the card face.** The inset flower is cream-white under a
    card named and written for bright yellow. That was the second reason the
    inset was excluded, Oscar's call restores it knowing that, and the question
    is unchanged: one fresh bloom May–September says whether the name is right.
    Flagged to Oscar in the same reply, not smoothed over.

- **v14.52 (264 dealt / 82 held — Common Box dealt on its opposite leaves)**:
  *Buxus sempervirens*, held since the UK-favourites batch of 2026-08-10, dealt
  from Oscar's own frame of 2026-09-05.
  - **Uncropped, orientation 6 baked**, restaged at 1200x1600 like the last two
    deals rather than `deal-plant.js`'s 900x1200. Foliage only, which is the
    honest state of a box in September; the Jan–Dec peak on the card is
    evergreen interest and was never a bloom claim.
  - **What the frame actually proves**: small glossy entire leaves in opposite
    pairs on squarish pale stems. That is *Buxus* and not the deck's two *Ilex
    crenata* cards ('Jenny', 'Kinme'), whose leaves are alternate — the one
    confusion this bench invites, because the two are sold as each other's
    substitute and look identical at a pace. What it does **not** prove is the
    cultivar: filed as the straight species on Oscar's statement, on the same
    footing as the rosemary register entry, and labelled [Inference] there.
  - Card data untouched. The values it carries (H6, 4–8 m ultimate, pestRisk
    16 for blight and box tree moth) were settled in the batch that wrote it
    and are not re-derived here — [Unverified] against RHS from this
    environment, as with every deal since egress was blocked.
  - `sharp` had to be reinstalled globally this session (`npm i -g sharp`);
    without it `optimise-photos.js --check` skips silently and the card would
    have shipped with **no WebP**, which is the only file the app loads.
- **v14.51 (267 dealt / 85 held — 'Dark Knight' dealt on the resend)**: the
  gold-leaved Caryopteris frame parked in v14.49 came back with the same
  name attached, and a resend is the owner's answer (v12-era Pinus mugo
  precedent). Dealt; parked copy retired. The one thing the deal does not
  settle is the card's own *"grey-green foliage"* clause under a gold
  photograph — flagged in VERIFY-QUEUE 69 for Oscar rather than rewritten.

- **v14.50 (three photographs replaced at Oscar's request — Hebe, Star
  Jasmine, Kinme)**: no data changed; three cards look different.
  - **Rhubarb Crumble loses the mirror.** The kaleidoscope (v-2026-08-17) was
    built from a photo that was two thirds paving; Oscar's verdict on the
    result was blunt, and the fix is the one the mirror was standing in for
    — a full frame of the plant. The EDITION entry is retired in place with a
    comment; the CSS and the `mirror` field stay for a card that earns it.
    perf-test's halo comment counted "two themed cards"; there is one now.
  - **Star Jasmine re-aimed.** The card had a tight crop of this frame at
    40% 45%; the wider original at 30% 45% keeps the whole truss and the
    leaves.
  - **Kinme: the cutout goes.** The black-background cutout was the card's
    master, not a composite source; the uncut frame of the same sprig
    replaces it. The old files are in git history, nothing is parked.
  - All three replacements are written into `CREDITS.json` on the file's
    own licence line, the Photinia way (item 32), so the swap is on the
    record without a parked copy.

- **v14.49 (241 dealt / 85 held — Viburnum opulus dealt, Caryopteris 'Dark
  Knight' held, Sapphire Ring becomes a swap card)**: two JSONs, three
  photographs, and Oscar named two of the three.
  - **Sapphire Ring swap, at Oscar's request.** The card photo has never shown
    a flower; the new frame does. Registered in `PHOTO_SWAP`, both frames
    verified on the rendered card. The swap bar ("nothing else in the deck
    needs this") is unchanged: this one passes it because the owner asked
    for the second story, and the flower is the name.
  - **The Caryopteris photograph is gold-leaved, so it is not 'Dark Knight'.**
    'Dark Knight' is grey-green; the frame is bright gold foliage under
    blue flowers, which is what the deck's dealt *Caryopteris* 'Worcester
    Gold' looks like (its own card photo is the same gold foliage, no
    flowers). Card held, frame parked as
    `caryopteris-gold-flowering-unconfirmed.jpg`; VERIFY-QUEUE 69 puts the
    obvious question to Oscar — is this a flowering frame for Worcester
    Gold, and should IT become a swap card too?
  - **Two schema conversions, labelled, not silent.** Both JSONs arrived
    with `hue` and `peak` as prose ("White and red", "Late spring to early
    summer"). The Hakonechloa the same morning was refused for the same
    fields, but it was a duplicate anyway; these are new cards with (for the
    Viburnum) an owner-confirmed photograph, so the numbers were set from
    the text and every conversion is recorded in the card's own `uncertain`
    block and in VQ 62, with the as-sent JSON kept beside the fitted one.
  - **Soil fitted to the panel, the fit-incoming way.** Both soil strings
    (52 and 56 chars, warnings 117 and 113) rendered as ink spilling out of
    the soil panel on the first screenshot. Short forms were written to the
    26/44 budgets and the originals kept; this is the rule
    `tools/fit-incoming.js` has applied to every wishlist card, now applied
    to a pasted one.

- **v14.48 (240 dealt / 84 held — Persicaria, Veronicastrum; Hydrangea
  'Groundbreaker Blush' held)**: three researched cards from one bench visit,
  three photographs, and the send order disagreed with the plants again.
  - **The order was Veronicastrum, Hydrangea, Persicaria; the photographs were
    a woody prostrate shrub, the Veronicastrum, the Persicaria.** Capture times
    (11:31:17, 11:32:05, 11:32:14) say all three were shot in a single minute.
    The two that identify themselves were dealt; the one that does not is held.
  - **Photo 1 shows no flower and is not confirmed.** Brown horizontal woody
    stems with lenticels and paired-to-whorled serrate leaves — a shrub, so
    not the herbaceous Veronicastrum, and `[Inference]` the low *Hydrangea
    paniculata* by elimination. Not dealt on elimination: parked as
    `hydrangea-groundbreaker-foliage-unconfirmed.jpg`, card held, Oscar to
    confirm (VERIFY-QUEUE 67), same posture as the Vitex pair (item 58).
  - **The Veronicastrum photograph carries the burned-in AI label** and is
    dealt the Houttuynia way: focus 50% 0%, label outside the window, marker
    recorded verbatim. Its C2PA manifest is the plain-capture shape (item 44
    batch note) yet the visible label is there — so the manifest alone is not
    a clean-capture proof; recorded as observed, not resolved.
  - Persicaria's soil value is the first to trip the validator's 36-character
    measured limit and ship anyway: it shrinks to three lines and stays legible.
    Kept as researched rather than paraphrased; flagged for Oscar.
  - **perf-test's halo budget raised a third time, delta only, 24 → 32.** The
    stacked-shadow rounding at the deck edge read Δ24 at 238 cards, exactly on
    the budget, and Δ25–26 at 240. Re-measured per the check's own rule: a
    staged leak on this deck diffs at 18288 px / Δ420, so the raised budget
    is still 16x under a real leak. Pixel budget untouched at 256 (31 seen).

- **v14.47 (263 dealt / 83 held — a pot label settles a photo AND catches a
  crossed cultivar code)**: *Physocarpus opulifolius* ALL BLACK ('Minall2')
  dealt, and the deck's two dark ninebark cards corrected.
  - **VQ 60 closes on evidence rather than on a guess.** One ninebark
    photograph had been parked because two dark-leaved cards ('All Black' and
    LITTLE DEVIL) both fitted and the pot label in frame was unreadable. Oscar
    photographed the label: *PHYSOCARPUS OPULIFOLIUS ALL BLACK® 'Minall2' cov*,
    at 17:27:22, with the leaf frame at 17:27:33. **Eleven seconds** — same
    plant, same minute, which is the Cedrus swap-pair trick used as proof of
    identity instead of proof of lighting. That is now the cheapest way to
    settle any cultivar this deck cannot tell apart by eye.
  - **The label also caught a real data error, and it is why this pair was
    confusing in the first place.** The deck's LITTLE DEVIL card carried
    `('Minall2')` — but 'Minall2' is ALL BLACK's cultivar code. LITTLE DEVIL is
    `'Donna May'` (PP22634). Both cards corrected: `Physocarpus opulifolius ALL
    BLACK ('Minall2')` and `Physocarpus opulifolius LITTLE DEVIL ('Donna May')`,
    with the evidence and the old wrong code written into each `cvs` field so
    nobody re-derives it. **A card carrying another cultivar's breeder code is
    worse than a blank one** — it is wrong in the one field a nursery would
    check.
  - LITTLE DEVIL stays held; its photograph has never arrived. The two are told
    apart by size (1–1.5 m against 1.5–2.5 m), not by leaf colour, so a photo
    for it still needs a label or a scale reference.
  - The parked file was **renamed, not deleted**: it is a real bench frame of a
    now-identified plant, so it lives on as
    `physocarpus-opulifolius-all-black-bench.jpg` rather than keeping a
    `-dark-unidentified` name that is no longer true.

- **v14.46 (262 dealt / 84 held — a refused photograph becomes its own card)**:
  *Daphne* × *transatlantica* PINK FRAGRANCE ('Blapink'), and the sequence is the
  point. In August 2026 a Daphne photograph arrived for *"the only daphne in
  deck"* — *D. bholua* 'Jacqueline Postill', held. It was **parked rather than
  dealt** on calendar evidence: 'Jacqueline Postill' flowers Jan–Mar, its own
  card says *"in the depths of winter"*, and the picture was in full bloom in
  August on a low bushy plant with small narrow leaves (VERIFY-QUEUE 44, whose
  `[Inference]` named the *transatlantica* group).
  - **Oscar has now confirmed it: PINK FRAGRANCE.** The inference was right, and
    the card that photograph was originally sent for stays HELD, still waiting
    for a winter shot. Refusing a photo bought a correct card instead of a
    wrong one — VQ 44 closes as identified.
  - He supplied a clearer frame for the new card, so the deck now holds two
    photographs of this plant: the parked original and the dealt one.
  - **What could NOT be verified is written on the card, not smoothed over.**
    RHS's page for 'Blapink' is unreachable from this environment (egress
    blocked), so the H5 rating is carried across from the sibling ETERNAL
    FRAGRANCE ('Blafra') in the same hybrid group and the `hardinessNote` says
    exactly that. Hardiness is the deck's most error-prone field; it wants a
    label check before this card is trusted on a bench. Flowering (Apr–Oct) and
    the 0.9–1.2 m dimensions carry the same kind of note.
  - Populates `toxicity` (all parts harmful, sap irritant) and `compliance`
    (PBR) — the third PBR card since the LEGAL plaque shipped.

- **v14.45 (260 dealt / 84 held — the Campsis photo swap: a crop that threw the
  identification away)**: Oscar's verdict on the *Campsis grandiflora* frame was
  blunt — *"the way you cropped this photo sucks"* — and he was right for a
  reason worth keeping. The outgoing master was zoomed so far into one trumpet
  that the petal went soft and the pinnate foliage left the frame entirely. On
  this genus that is not a taste call: the leaflets ARE the identification, and
  a big orange trumpet at that magnification could be *Bignonia*, *Podranea* or
  *Tecoma*. A card that cannot be told apart from three other plants is not
  doing its job.
  - **The replacement is his supplied frame, trimmed 15% off the bottom and
    nothing else** — pot, hand, and two nursery labels he had redacted himself
    in red marker.
  - **The trim is measured twice, which is the transferable part.** Full height
    was refused by `reframe-photo.js` outright. A first pass at `h: 0.90` passed
    the tool, then rendered with a sliver of redacted label beside the soil
    panel — because the topmost label sits at y 0.560 and 0.560/0.90 = 0.622,
    exactly the plaque line the check compares against. Passing a boundary check
    by landing ON the boundary is not passing it. `h: 0.85` puts the label at
    0.659 and the band is clean, confirmed on the rendered card rather than in
    the arithmetic alone.
  - **This card lived on a third parallel branch**, not on the live line — it
    was merged forward here with the rest of that line (Acanthus, Galium, and
    the five duplicates already resolved to live).

- **v14.44 (257 dealt / 84 held — a five-card line merges in, and two parallel
  duplicates resolve to the live copies)**: a second session had been dealing
  cards on a feature branch while this line advanced; the merge brought in its
  five unique cards — *Anisodontea capensis* 'Ib201-7' (CARNIVAL LIGHTS CANDY
  APPLE), *Cyclamen hederifolium* f. *albiflorum*, *Dahlia* 'Kelvin
  Floodlight', *Phygelius aequalis* 'Trewidden Pink' and *Solanum pyracanthos*
  — each with its register row above, incoming JSON, CREDITS entry and photo.
  - **Two plants had been dealt on BOTH lines from the same sends**: the
    Disporum and the 'Winter Moonbeam' hellebore. The live line's copies win —
    they deployed first, and for the hellebore its file is also the better one
    (a full signed capture manifest, where the feature branch's copy of the
    same plant carried a Galaxy `Photo assist` generative-edit manifest and a
    visible label). The feature branch's register rows, rows and photos for
    those two were dropped in the merge; its CREDITS entries did not survive
    either, so no record contradicts the files on disk.
  - **Both lines had also independently raised perf-test's halo delta ceiling
    for the same red**, each with its own staged-leak measurement (36.5k px /
    Δ375 both times). The live line's note and its warning against a fourth
    blind raise are kept; the ceiling stays at the live line's 30 — a fresh
    measurement on the merged 257-card deck reads 25 px / max delta 22 (staged
    leak 36505 / 375), inside it with headroom, so no fourth raise was needed.
  - Notable from the five: the Solanum's C2PA manifest precisely declares
    Oscar's own PhotoEditor sticker edit (the flower; `isScaleAI:false`, no
    generative agent) — the Salvia 'Black and Blue' class with better
    paperwork; the Phygelius arrived order-swapped against its JSON and was
    assigned on the plant (Vitex rule), and its card says "dusky-pink" while
    the frame reads coral-red in hard sun — [flag] in its register row.

- **v14.43 (the photo swap had been showing one photo since r79)**: Oscar sent the
  Exochorda as a pair and asked for *"the flash between feature"*, adding that it
  *"has had some bugs in the past so it may need repairing"*. It did. `markHot()`
  loaded `.tphoto img` — `querySelector`, the FIRST image — so a swap card's
  `<img class="alt">` never received a `src`. It had been loading anyway as a side
  effect: the old `tricklePhotos` set `src` on every buried image, alt included.
  r79 (2026-08-21) changed that to `fetch()`, which was right (1.1GB of decode
  targets was what was killing iOS), and without anyone noticing it cut the
  swap's second frame off. From that day every two-photo card — Cedrus, Gunnera,
  both Cercis — blinked to black and back to the **same** photograph.
  - **Fix**: `markHot` now sets `src` on, and decodes, every `.tphoto img` in the
    fetch window. One `querySelectorAll`. The CSS cut is untouched — it was never
    the problem, and it is already as simple as this gets: two keyframes, gated
    on `.hot`, off under reduced motion.
  - **Why nobody saw it**: the cut goes through black, so the eye reads a blink
    and moves on; and the only assertion that touched swap cards was perf-test
    counting their two `<img>` elements — which exist whether or not either has
    loaded. **features-test now checks the FETCH window**: every swap card in it
    carries a `src` on both frames, the alt decodes to real pixels, and at least
    one swap card exists so the check cannot pass on nothing.
  - Recorded in the code comment at the fix, so the next person who replaces
    the trickle does not repeat r79's side effect.
- **v14.42 (aftercare, the hardiness lens, and a drought chip)**: three features
  in one pass, all of them data the deck already owned finally becoming visible.
  - **Aftercare leads the back.** `water` and `prune` are on every card and
    rendered nowhere on the card itself — only in the search view. They are now
    the first two rows of the trade sheet (CARD-BACK.md section A), above the
    commerce.
  - **`hardinessNote` is a card field**, backfilled onto **87 cards** from the
    research files, and the lens now opens on the hardiness crest too: hold the
    H shield and it says what the rating means (the RHS band in plain terms plus
    the temperature range) and prints the card's own note verbatim. The Butia —
    whose *"may tolerate about −10°C in ideal sheltered sites"* was the sentence
    that made this field worth building — is the proof card.
  - **A 🌵 Drought tolerant filter chip**, per Oscar. It matches the card's own
    CLAIM (water/soil/resilience/uses text), not a guess from the thirst number,
    using the same dry-side regex as `tools/plant-sense.js` **with negations
    stripped first** — so Hydrangea 'Zorro' ("avoid dry soil") does not show up
    in a drought list. 62 cards match; the two regexes are marked keep-in-sync.
  - **Two bugs found on the way, both worth their entries:**
    1. **The invisible LEARNED stamp was eating presses on the crest.** It sits
       at z-index 3 exactly over the shield, opacity 0, and took the hit. Pure
       drag feedback now carries `pointer-events:none`. Found by hit-testing the
       crest centre and getting `DIV.stamp` back.
    2. **A backfill ran before its field was in FIELDS and silently wrote
       nothing.** `formatCard` serialises only keys in FIELDS, so the script
       reported 87 cards updated in memory while the file gained zero — the
       exact silent-loss path `plants-tool.js`'s own comments warn about, from
       the inside. The order is now a rule: **schema first, then backfill**, and
       verify with a grep of the written file, not the script's own count.

- **v14.41 (the LENS — press-and-hold makes the power points readable)**: hold a
  finger on the plant power points plaque (or the soil panel, or the aspect band)
  for half a second and a readable copy opens **above the finger**; let go and it
  disappears. Oscar's spec, built to his shape: hold-to-release, no button, no
  state to get stuck in.
  - **Measured before designing, and the measurement rewrote the brief.** Every
    value on those panels renders at **5.8 real pixels** on a 390px phone — the
    ink fitter's 6.5px floor times the 0.89 card scale, on every row, not just
    the long ones. The readable minimum is ~11px. So this was never "some people
    struggle"; nothing on that plaque has ever been readable on a phone without
    pinch-zooming the OS.
  - **That ruled out magnifying.** Scaling the panel to full screen width gives
    9.2px — still under the floor, and blurry. The lens instead **re-typesets the
    same values from the plant row at 17px**: same Georgia, same parchment, the
    card's own widget icons one size up, `fmt5`/`careLabel`/`splitSoil`/
    `parseMonths`/`extractFacing` reused so the lens can never disagree with the
    card. Blank stays blank, same as everywhere.
  - **Gesture safety, each case exercised in a browser before the gate**: a drag
    that starts on the plaque still swipes (movement past the same 10px threshold
    that separates tap from swipe disarms the hold); the release that closes the
    lens is swallowed so it neither taps nor arms the double-tap flip; while the
    lens is up the card ignores finger drift entirely; `touchcancel` closes it;
    reduced-motion drops the scale animation. Front panels only — the selector
    simply never matches a FULLART front or the back.
  - **A test lesson for free**: the first browser check reported the feature dead
    because it measured the plaque's position before the staged deal had settled,
    then pressed stale coordinates that landed on the photograph. The feature was
    fine; the probe pressed the wrong place. Wait for `data-dealing` to clear
    before measuring anything on a card.

- **v14.40 (238 dealt / 81 held — Sanguisorba, and a perf check that counted the
  wrong thing)**: *Sanguisorba* 'Pink Brushes', a new genus, from a split Oscar
  assembled himself. Kept whole and uncropped.
  - **The gate went 16/17 and it was the TEST that was wrong, not the card.**
    perf-test's *"buried photos are not painted"* counted visible `<img>`
    elements as a proxy for painted cards. That held until the Cedrus swap card
    from v14.39 reached the painted window: a swap card carries **two** images in
    one `.tphoto` and cross-fades between them, so the proxy read 5 painted
    photos across 4 painted cards and failed a card behaving exactly as designed.
  - **Diagnosed before touching anything.** A probe printed every visible photo
    with its card index and flags: four distinct cards, none of them `.deep`, and
    the fifth image was the Cedrus's own `alt` frame on the same card. Only then
    was the check changed.
  - **The fix asserts the real invariant instead of loosening the number.** Two
    checks now: *no `.deep` card paints a photo* (which is what the budget was
    always about, and is asserted directly rather than inferred), and a count
    ceiling of `MAX_PAINTED + swap frames in the window`, so a genuine leak still
    fails. **Not a threshold bump** — the ceiling is derived from what the window
    legitimately holds, and it would have caught this batch if anything really
    had leaked.

- **v14.39 (237 dealt / 81 held — Styrax, Korean pine, Atlas cedar)**: three
  cards, two of them uncropped, and the deck's fourth photo swap.
  - **Oscar named the mapping this time** — *"first plant is styrax, second the
    pinus"* — and it agreed with the leaves, which is the opposite of the Vitex
    pair two days ago. Named and checked beats named alone; both were still
    verified against the foliage before dealing.
  - **The Cedrus is a swap card.** Its `visual` promises two things a single
    frame cannot hold: creamy-white new tips AND blue-green massed needles. The
    close-up is the cultivar, the wider frame is the plant. **Four seconds apart
    in the EXIF**, so the pair is honest in a way a swap assembled from two
    visits would not be — same plant, same light, same minute.
  - **An apostrophe collision, solved by the deck's own precedent.** *Horstmann's*
    inside a single-quoted cultivar name failed the validator's balanced-quote
    check. The deck already settled this: *Erysimum* `'Bowles’s Mauve'` and
    *Hydrangea paniculata* `'Wim’s Red'` carry a typographic U+2019 in `latin`
    and a plain apostrophe in `common`. Followed exactly, rather than inventing a
    third convention or mangling the name.
  - **Two of three needed no crop at all.** The crop-less rule (v14.34) is now
    the normal outcome rather than the exception: five of the last eight
    photographs have gone through untouched or with a single problem-fixing trim.

- **v14.38 (the LEGAL plaque — item 0c closed)**: `compliance` is now a card
  field, a CSV column and a rendered block, and **20 cards carry one**. With the
  SAFETY plaque from v14.30, item 0c is finished.
  - **Reading the deck's own notes first changed the design again.** There are
    not thirteen reasons a plant fails to comply, there are **six**, and one of
    them accounts for most of the cards: **breeder's rights (12)**, Schedule 9
    (4), an outright sale/propagation restriction (Gunnera), controlled waste
    (knotweed), a plant-health host (the Olive), and wild-harvest controls
    (*Dicksonia*). Final tiers: **2 restricted, 6 legal duty, 12 licence.**
  - **So the plaque has two weights, and deliberately is NOT the safety plaque's
    twin.** A statutory duty is engraved — slate ground, cut rule down the side,
    small-caps. Breeder's rights gets a quiet grey strip, because **dressing a
    licensing note as a legal warning devalues the warnings that are real**. PBR
    is an invoice question about what the NURSERY may propagate; it is not a duty
    on anyone holding the plant, and on a learning card it is close to noise.
  - **The information was never missing — it was smuggled.** Eleven cards already
    showed legal warnings, but only because someone had stuffed them into fields
    meant for other things: `resilience`, `type`, `returnRisk`, `soil`. A
    Schedule 9 offence was sitting in a field called *Return risk*, in the buyer
    grid, in the same type as pot sizes. **20 field edits** moved those into
    `compliance` and cleared the duplicates, keeping the horticulture (Cotoneaster
    keeps *"otherwise superb for bees and birds"*; *Rosa rugosa* keeps *"salt,
    sand and drought proof · suckers"*). Where the smuggled prose was BETTER than
    the researched line — knotweed's, which spelled out the controlled-waste duty
    — the better wording won and became the plaque.
  - **The two `soil` warnings were left alone on purpose** (the Olive's Xylella
    note, knotweed's). They render on the card FRONT, a different surface, so
    they are not duplicates of the back plaque.
  - **THIRD NEGATION BUG, caught before it shipped.** The ban tier matched
    `\bbanned\b` inside *"Sale is not banned, but it must not be planted in the
    wild"* and tiered **Virginia creeper as RESTRICTED** — a red plaque on a plant
    that is perfectly legal to sell. After "should not be treated as edible"
    (v14.30) and "avoid dry soil" (v14.31), this is now a standing rule, not an
    anecdote: **when a classifier keys on a word, strip the negations before the
    ladder runs, and test the classifier against every row of real data before
    trusting it.** All three bugs were found the same way — by running the tiering
    over the actual corpus and reading every line of the output.

- **v14.37 (234 dealt / 81 held — three in, and the crop-less rule earning its
  keep)**: *Eupatorium* 'Pink Frost' and *Cryptomeria* Serama new, *Erysimum*
  'Bowles's Mauve' filled from the hold list on Oscar's identification.
  - **Three photographs, three different answers to "should this be cropped?"**,
    and the rule from v14.34 decided all three without argument. The Eupatorium:
    nothing wrong with it, so **nothing done** — pot below the plaque line, aspect
    already 0.75. The Erysimum: the lower quarter is bare gravel pushing the plant
    out of the card band, which is on the list of real problems, so **trimmed**.
    The Cryptomeria: **3% off the bottom** and not a pixel more, because a
    fingertip holding the branch was showing along the edge. A finger is a label:
    it is a thing in the frame that should not be on a customer-facing card.
  - **`deal-plant.js` shortchanged a master again** — the Erysimum came out
    1200x1200 only because its crop was square; the same tool would have cost a
    portrait master a quarter of its width. Restaged from the crop as v14.36 says.
    That is twice in two sessions; the note in v14.36 stands.
  - **Ninth `compliance` line with nowhere to render** (Serama is PBR protected).
  - Both new cards carry a `visual` whose flower half is missing from the
    photograph — the Eupatorium's pink flower heads (Jul–Sep) and the Erysimum's
    mauve spires (near year-round). Neither is a defect; both are one photograph
    away, and the Erysimum's is the easiest reshoot on the whole list.

- **v14.36 (231 dealt / 82 held — the Vitex pair, settled by the leaves)**:
  Oscar confirmed the reading in one word. The narrow-leaflet plant is
  **'Delta Blues'**, the broad-leaflet plant is **'Flip Side'** — the opposite of
  the order they arrived in.
  - **The evidence that settled it was already on the card.** 'Flip Side's own
    `cvs` line reads *"hybrid of Vitex trifolia 'Purpurea' × V. agnus-castus"*,
    and *trifolia* is exactly the broad, purple-backed leaf in the second
    photograph. Nothing external was needed; the research Oscar had already done
    contained the answer, and reading it beat trusting the send order.
  - **Masters restaged at 1200×1600, not the 900×1200 `deal-plant.js` writes.**
    That tool caps the LONG edge at 1200 while `add-plant.js` caps the WIDTH — a
    portrait photo dealt through the former loses a quarter of its width for no
    reason. Worth remembering whenever a held card is dealt from an already-
    prepared master: deal it, then restage the master from the original.
  - Parked filenames retired and their CREDITS entries removed. The assignment
    and the reason for it now live on each photo's licence line, so the next
    person to touch these two does not re-derive it.
  - **A stale static server on :8477 killed a gate run mid-flight** (exit 137
    after app-test). It was left behind by a screenshot step whose `kill` did not
    take. If a gate dies for no visible reason, check the port before suspecting
    the change.

- **v14.35 (229 dealt / 84 held — one dealt, two held on a mapping question)**:
  three cards and three photographs arrived together, and for two of them the
  order they came in and the leaves inside them disagree.
  - ***Cephalanthus* 'Fiber Optics' dealt.** Its photograph is unmistakable and
    both readings agree on it.
  - **Both *Vitex* cards HELD, both photographs parked.** By arrival order the
    narrow-leaflet photo is 'Flip Side'; by the leaves it is 'Delta Blues'.
    **'Flip Side' is a *V. trifolia* 'Purpurea' × *V. agnus-castus* hybrid** —
    Oscar's own `cvs` line says so — sold for broad, purple-backed foliage, while
    'Delta Blues' is a straight *V. agnus-castus* with narrow palmate leaflets
    `[Inference]`. The two cards are otherwise near-identical: same genus, same
    First Editions series, both blue, same aspect, soil and pruning. **A swap
    would be invisible on the card and wrong on both**, which is exactly the
    condition for parking rather than guessing. VQ 58.
  - **EXIF settled the arrival order and did NOT settle the question.** Capture
    times are 16:17:26 (narrow), 16:17:33 (broad), 16:19:05 (buttonbush) — so the
    upload order was not the capture order, which is worth knowing when reasoning
    from "he sent them in this order" ever feels safe. It tells us which was shot
    first; it cannot tell us which card either belongs to.
  - Parked names describe the LEAF, not a guess at the plant:
    `vitex-unidentified-narrow-leaflets.jpg`, `vitex-unidentified-broad-leaflets.jpg`.

- **v14.34 (crop less — a standing correction from Oscar)**: the Gaura composite
  was cropped to its flower frame and Oscar reversed it: *"don't change the image
  so much... this shows off both parts of the plant which is helpful for ident."*
  He is right, and the principle is broader than one card.
  - **A garden-centre card is an identification aid before it is a photograph.**
    A frame carrying leaf AND flower together is doing MORE work than a prettier
    frame carrying one of them. Two panels are a feature, not a defect to tidy
    away.
  - **The standing rule from here: crop to fix a PROBLEM, not to improve a
    composition.** Real problems are the aspect gate (0.75–1.0), a legible label
    or price ticket, a subject that would land outside the card band, and dead
    space that pushes the plant out of the frame. "It would look better tighter"
    is not on that list, and neither is symmetry.
  - Restaged at `verdict: as-is`, which put the master back up from 1098 px to the
    full **1200×1600** — so the tighter crop had also been the lower-resolution
    one. On the card the seam now falls about two-thirds across: foliage left,
    flowers right, both legible.
  - **One open consequence.** The *Rhodanthemum* 'Zagora Yellow' (v14.28) was
    cropped the same way — its pasted inset flower panel was excluded. That case
    is not identical: the inset is a picture-in-picture overlay rather than a
    side-by-side pair, and its flower is the cream one that contradicts the card's
    own name (VQ 49), so restoring it would put the open question on the card
    face. **Oscar's call, flagged not acted on.**

- **v14.33 (228 dealt / 82 held — Gaura 'Rosy Jane')**: a second composite, a
  naming inconsistency left for Oscar, and the eighth homeless compliance line.
  - **The seam was measured, not guessed.** A column-to-column difference scan
    put the join at x=0.630 with a clear spike above every other edge in the
    frame, and the crop starts at 0.634 — clear of it. Worth doing that way every
    time: a crop that clips a composite seam puts a hard vertical line down the
    middle of a card and it is the kind of thing nobody notices until it ships.
  - **The right frame was the whole card.** Left panel soft foliage, right panel
    sharp flowers showing exactly what the `visual` promises. Taking the flowers
    costs resolution — 1098 px master against a 1200 standard — and that is the
    correct trade, because the card derivative is capped at 1000 px so nothing
    visible is lost, while a soft foliage macro would have lost the plant.
  - **It breaks the deck's own trade-name convention and was NOT corrected.** The
    deck writes trade-named cultivars as `TRADE NAME ('code')` — the sibling card
    is *Oenothera lindheimeri* **GAUDI ROSE ('Florgaucomro')**. This one arrived
    as `'Rosy Jane'` with the code in `cvs`, where the convention would give
    `ROSY JANE ('Harrosy')`. Renaming a plant is not mine to do; VQ 55 has the
    one-line fix, including that it moves the photo slug.
  - **Eighth card with a `compliance` line and nowhere to put it.** VQ 56. The
    rail built for the SAFETY plaque is still waiting for its legal half.

- **v14.32 (227 dealt / 82 held — Artemisia 'Powis Castle')**: the deck's first
  *Artemisia*, and the first photograph in this whole run that wanted **no crop**.
  - The frame arrived at exactly 0.75 with the subject already in the card band,
    so `reframe-photo.js` ran at `verdict: as-is` — a full-frame pass whose only
    job is to bake the EXIF rotation into the pixels. Master 1200×1600, the
    largest staged this week. **Worth remembering that "as-is" is a real verdict**:
    the tool is a gate, not a cropper, and a good frame should be allowed through
    intact rather than trimmed to look like it was worked on.
  - `hue: 0` on a silver-leaved plant looks wrong and is not. `hue` drives ONLY
    the fallback gradient behind a photo that fails to load, so on a card with a
    working photograph it is never seen — and the deck already carries hue 0 on a
    pure-white Scabiosa. Checked rather than "corrected".
  - Ratings tripped the un-converted-scale warning again; `growthSpeed 9` settles
    it, same as the Erigeron. That check has now fired on four cards in two days
    and been a false alarm every time — the growthSpeed test resolves it in
    seconds and is the reason it stays cheap to ignore.

- **v14.31 (226 dealt / 82 held — Zorro and the blood grass)**: two new cards,
  the first to arrive after the SAFETY plaque shipped, and between them they show
  both halves of what is now built and what is not.
  - ***Zorro*** carries **both** a toxicity line and a `compliance` line. The
    toxicity is on the card, on the new plaque. The compliance — *"PBR protected ·
    commercial propagation restricted"* — **still has nowhere to go**, and that is
    now seven cards with a legal note the app cannot show. VQ 53; the rail is
    built and one block would carry it.
  - **A real bug in `plant-sense`, found by the Zorro card.** It flagged
    *"prose says drought tolerant but thirst is 14/20"* on a hydrangea whose card
    says *"Avoid dry soil · Keep evenly moist"* — the dry-side pattern was matching
    the words "dry soil" **inside a negation**. Fixed by stripping negated phrases
    before the test rather than widening the pattern. It turns out **three other
    moisture-loving cards** carried the same latent mis-signal (*H. paniculata*
    'Wim's Red', *Sorbaria* 'Sem', *Hosta* 'Emerald Charger') and only escaped the
    flag by sitting below thirst 14. This is the **third negation bug in two days**
    — after "should not be treated as edible" in the toxicity ladder — and the
    lesson is the same one both times: **test the negation before the keyword.**
  - **The photo register now records which shots are current-season.** Both of
    these are Galaxy S21 archive frames — Hydrangea 22 May 2024, Imperata 19 July
    2024 — where every other photo this run is an August 2026 S24 capture. That is
    not a fault, and it is the whole explanation for the Hydrangea being in bud
    rather than in flower, so it belongs in the register rather than being
    rediscovered later. VQ 54.
  - The Imperata is one letter from *Pennisetum* **'Rubrum'**, already dealt.
    Different genus, both red grasses, six grasses in the deck now.

- **v14.30 (the SAFETY plaque — `toxicity` finally has somewhere to go)**: item
  0c is closed for toxicity. `toxicity` is now a card field, a CSV column and a
  rendered block on the trade back, and **44 researched notes that had been
  sitting unreadable in `data/incoming/` are on their cards.**
  - **The plaque is written in the FRONT's language, not the back's.** Aged
    paper, ink, Georgia small-caps, a painted hazard rule along the top. It sits
    ABOVE the buyer figures, because a safety line outranks a margin. This is
    also the first piece of the "make the back cool" work — the back is still a
    plain data sheet everywhere else, and now has one thing on it that looks
    like the card it belongs to.
  - **The field turned out not to be only hazards, and that changed the design.**
    Reading all 44 notes before writing the tiering: most are hazards, six are
    EDIBILITY notes (*"Ripe berries are edible and are also readily taken by
    birds"*), and one is a sourced all-clear from Kew. Printing "ripe berries are
    edible" under a red hazard rule would be worse than printing nothing, so the
    ladder carries five tiers — **Highly toxic / Toxic / Handle with care /
    Edible parts / No known hazard** — with their own inks and glyphs.
  - **Every rule was checked against the real corpus, one note at a time.** The
    ordering matters and was found by doing it: *"should not be treated as
    edible"* (Sarcococca) must be read as a hazard, so the negations are tested
    BEFORE the word "edible" is looked for; and a hazard word anywhere beats an
    edible mention in the same sentence, so Sambucus — cyanogenic leaves, edible
    flowers — lands on Toxic. Final split: 5 severe, 29 harmful, 3 caution,
    6 edible, 1 clear. An unrecognised note falls to *Handle with care*, never to
    *Toxic*.
  - **TIER IS A RENDERING DECISION, NOT A CLAIM.** The researched prose is always
    printed verbatim underneath; the tier only picks ink and glyph, exactly as
    `careLabel()` turns 11 into "Moderate" without altering the number.
  - **A blank prints nothing at all.** Blank means not researched, which is not
    the same as safe. A card that said "no toxicity recorded" would be read in a
    shop as "safe to eat", so the plaque simply does not appear.
  - Still open: **`compliance`** — the LEGAL half — has the same problem and the
    same rail is now there for it (Gunnera's ban, the Olive's Xylella note, six
    PBR cards). One block away, and Oscar's call whether it looks like this
    plaque or reads differently.

- **v14.29 (224 dealt / 81 held — the first two houseplants of this run)**:
  *Monstera deliciosa* and *Aloe vera*, both new, both indoor (H1b).
  - **`hardiness` was supplied as `H1B` and the schema refused it.** The rating
    is written `H1a`/`H1b`/`H1c` in the RHS scale, so the capital was normalised
    to `H1b` — same rating, same meaning, no data changed. Worth knowing that
    `check-plant-json` catches the casing rather than silently accepting a value
    the card renderer would then print inconsistently against every other H1b.
  - **Toxicity again, and this time it is the sharpest case yet.** Both cards
    carry populated `toxicity` — Monstera *"Harmful if eaten · skin and eye
    irritant"*, Aloe *"Harmful if eaten"* — and neither has anywhere to render.
    These are **houseplants**: handled indoors, pruned over a kitchen worktop,
    within reach of children and cats in a way a border shrub is not. The deck
    now has 15+ cards carrying safety text that no surface shows. **Item 0c is
    no longer a schema tidiness question.**
  - The Aloe took three crops and is still the weakest photograph of the batch —
    backlit, pot-heavy. Recorded in VQ 51 along with two identity notes: the
    unconfirmed *"Aloe massawana hybrid"* wording Oscar's own research correctly
    discarded, and the fact that heavy leaf spotting fits juvenile *A. vera* but
    fits several other spotted aloes just as well.
  - Both files: EXIF orientation 6 — landscape in a preview, portrait in the
    app — Galaxy S24, no C2PA manifest, no AI marker. **Second batch running
    where the preview orientation and the file orientation disagree**; reading
    the displayed frame before writing crop coordinates is now routine, not a
    catch.

- **v14.28 (222 dealt / 81 held — Lithodora and Rhodanthemum)**: two new cards,
  neither genus previously in the deck. Both photographs are August foliage; both
  cards lead on a flower.
  - **The Rhodanthemum is the one to read.** Its supplied file is a two-frame
    collage, and the flower in the pasted inset has **cream-white rays**, where
    the card is named and written for **bright yellow** daisies. Either it is
    'Zagora Yellow' photographed late — the yellows fade to cream with age
    `[Unverified]` — or the plant is the straight white species and the label is
    wrong. The foliage cannot separate them; they differ only in ray colour.
    Dealt on the foliage frame with the inset cropped out, so **the card asserts
    no flower colour at all** rather than asserting one the picture denies.
    VQ 49, and one fresh bloom in the garden settles it.
  - The Lithodora is the mild version of the same shape: no flowers in August,
    and the new flush is brighter than the "dark-green" its text names. Dealt;
    VQ 50; an April–July reshoot is a straight upgrade.
  - **A crop lesson worth keeping.** The Rhodanthemum's first crop looked right
    as a picture and read as a green blur on the card. When the master is WIDER
    than the card's 0.6165 slot, cover crops the sides and shows the master's
    full height, so the visible band is always the master's own 12–62% — an
    `object-position` Y override cannot move it. **The sharp region has to be
    put there by the crop box.** Re-cropped 0.09 lower and the leaves came up
    legible. Same geometry that made the Butia's focus override a no-op (v14.26),
    seen from the other side.
  - Both photos: EXIF Samsung Galaxy S24, Ultra HDR with a gain map, **no C2PA
    manifest at all** and no AI or generative marker — the same profile as the
    Erigeron, and recorded as that rather than as "clean C2PA". The collage is
    recorded as a collage in CREDITS.

- **v14.27 (220 dealt / 81 held — Mexican fleabane)**: *Erigeron karvinskianus*
  'Profusion', a NEW card; the deck held no *Erigeron* and no small daisy of any
  kind.
  - **The rating scale warning was a false alarm, and there is a way to prove
    it.** `check-plant-json` flags `pestRisk 3`, `thirst 4`, `careLevel 3` as
    possibly un-converted 0–5 ratings. `growthSpeed 12` settles it: 12 cannot
    exist on a 0–5 scale, so the whole set is on the app's 0–20 scale and the
    card reads *Easy 0.75/5, Thirst 1/5, Pests 0.75/5* — which is what a
    self-seeding wall daisy should say, and consistent with its own *"Low once
    established"* and *"drought tolerant"*. **Whenever that warning fires, check
    `growthSpeed` first**: it is the field most likely to exceed 5 and therefore
    the cheapest proof of which scale the JSON is on.
  - **EXIF orientation caught a second way.** The preview in chat was landscape;
    the file is orientation 6 and displays portrait. Crop coordinates read off
    the preview would have been rotated 90° from the frame the app renders.
    `reframe-photo.js` already handles the rotation (v14.21 fix) — but it
    handles it by trusting that the coordinates describe the DISPLAYED frame, so
    the frame has to be looked at before the numbers are written, not after.
  - Photo carries no C2PA manifest at all — no JUMBF box — unlike the Galaxy
    captures that do. It is a Samsung Ultra HDR capture (gain map in the XMP)
    with EXIF naming the Galaxy S24, and no AI or generative marker anywhere in
    the file. Recorded exactly that way rather than as "clean C2PA".
  - Oscar's own `uncertain` block notes RHS treats 'Profusion' as a synonym
    rather than an accepted cultivar. Kept on the card as supplied — VQ 48.

- **v14.26 (219 dealt / 81 held — the Jelly palm)**: *Butia capitata*, a NEW
  card rather than a replacement; the deck held no *Butia*. Oscar's own
  `uncertain` block flagged the taxonomic conflict before the photograph was
  opened, and the conflict is real: the label read *"Butia capitata (Cocos
  australis)"*, and **Cocos australis is a synonym of Syagrus romanzoffiana**,
  a different genus.
  - **The photograph settles the genus and not the species.** Armed petioles
    and stiff, single-plane, glaucous recurved leaflets are *Butia*; *Syagrus*
    is unarmed, glossy green and plumose. So the "Cocos australis" half of the
    label is a trade-label error `[Inference]`. *B. capitata* vs *B. odorata*
    is NOT separable from a crown photograph and has not been guessed at —
    VQ 47 carries it.
  - Dealt under the name Oscar's JSON carries and RHS still profiles. The
    card's `cvs` prints *"syn. Butia bonnetii; Cocos capitata"*; the erroneous
    *Cocos australis* was deliberately not copied onto it.
  - Photo: plain Galaxy S24 C2PA capture manifest — `c2pa.ingredient.v2`,
    `relationship parentOf`, no `digitalSourceType` and no *Photo assist*
    marker. An untouched original, recorded as such.
  - **A focus override was tried and then removed rather than left in.** At a
    0.780 master against the card's 0.6165 slot the photo is width-constrained,
    so `object-position`'s Y term changes nothing — two screenshots at `50% 40%`
    and `50% 50%` were pixel-identical. An entry that does nothing is worse than
    no entry, because the next person reads it as a decision.
  - **Fifth card to lose data at the schema, and the loss is a real one here**:
    `hardinessNote` ("H3; established plants may tolerate about -10°C in ideal
    sheltered sites"), `foliage`, `container`, `toxicity` and `compliance` all
    have nowhere to render. For a borderline-hardy palm being sold in the UK,
    the hardiness qualifier is the single most useful sentence on the card and
    it is the one that does not survive. Item 0c.
  - **A perf-test check was measuring the container, not the app.** "The card is
    already moving two frames after the release" asserted a 50ms wall-clock
    budget, but the sampler can only see movement on a frame it is given: traced
    here, the card had moved 60px by the sampler's SECOND frame, and that frame
    landed anywhere from 23ms to 63ms depending on machine load. It failed 4 runs
    out of 4 at deck 218 — the commit already pushed and green an hour earlier —
    so it was neither the new card nor the riffle change. It now asserts frame
    INDEX, which is what its own name always claimed, with a loose 250ms ceiling
    underneath to catch a genuine stall. Not a loosening: a stalled throw still
    fails, and the ms figure is still printed every run.

- **v14.25 (the riffle stops being O(deck), and a gate claim corrected)**: the
  previous commit's message said *"Gate: 17/17 sequential"*. It was not — that
  run came back **16/17**, `features-test` failing, and the message was written
  before the result was read. The failure was real and reproduced on its own,
  outside any parallel-run contention: **go-to-card took ~34s to reach the
  deepest card in a 218-card deck**, past the suite's 30s wait.
  - The cause is not the animation tempo and not photo priming — both were
    measured and neither dominates. **Re-stacking a single card costs ~108ms of
    layout at 218 cards** (idle frame 16ms), and the riffle moved one card per
    frame, so the cost of reaching the bottom card grew with the deck and had
    been growing quietly for weeks. One card tipped it over the cap; the slide
    started long before.
  - Fix: `cutUnder(n)` moves the far portion of the cut in **one DOM pass**
    through a fragment, and only the last `GOTO_SHOW` (10) tucks still fly. The
    landing order is identical to tucking one at a time, `order`/`history` are
    untouched exactly as before, and the visible flourish is unchanged.
    **34.2s → 2.6s**, same card on top.
  - The suite's 30s wait was a backstop that silently absorbed the whole slide.
    Both riffle waits are now a **12s budget** (~4x headroom) with the measured
    numbers written in, so the next regression fails loudly instead of creeping.
  - Standing lesson, and it is the second time this session: **a gate result is
    not a gate result until it has been read.** No commit message may state a
    gate outcome the run has not actually returned.

- **v14.24 (MIRRORED effect; five cards held, one duplicate refused)**: the
  kaleidoscope Oscar spotted in a contact sheet is now a real effect. The card's
  own `<img>` becomes the left half pulled to `object-position:100%`, a mirrored
  copy forms the right half, and a masked backdrop-blur strip smudges the seam,
  so the two halves meet as a reflection rather than a cut. **Rendering only —
  the master is untouched**, for the same reason as the edition blur: a mirrored
  plant is not evidence of a plant that grew symmetrically.
  **One bug worth keeping:** the first build gave Rhubarb Crumble the Magnolia's
  orange treatment, because the `edition` class was applied whenever an EDITION
  entry existed. Theme and effect are now separate — `edition` needs
  `ink`/`dark`/`masterText`, `mirrored` needs `mirror` — so a card can take an
  effect without inheriting someone else's colours.
  Five new cards are **held** pending photographs, and `Lupinus` 'The Governor'
  was refused as a duplicate of a card already in the hold block (VERIFY-QUEUE 45).

- **v14.23 (212 dealt / 82 held)**: *Veronica* 'Rhubarb Crumble', and it closes
  the unidentified variegated Hebe from VERIFY-QUEUE 38 — same frame, now named.
  The parked file and its CREDITS entry were removed rather than left as a
  duplicate of a dealt card's photo.
  **The naming split from VERIFY-QUEUE 43 is now 2:1 and worth settling.** The
  deck files 'Emerald Gem' and 'Rhubarb Crumble' under *Veronica* and 'Red Edge'
  under *Hebe*. Every one carries "Hebe" in its `common`, so nothing is unfindable
  — but the botanical column now disagrees with itself three times over, and the
  next Hebe makes it four.
  **Worth flagging on this card specifically: H3.** Oscar's own note says the
  rating comes from trade material because the cultivar is too new for an
  exact-name RHS profile. H3 means it needs frost protection — a real
  sales-counter fact on a plant being sold as a patio container shrub.

- **v14.22 (EDITION: one-off themed cards, and the Magnolia recrop)**: Oscar
  asked for four things on *Magnolia acuminata* and all four are in.
  **The recrop.** The first crop cut the seed pod off, which he disliked and was
  right to — the pod is the whole reason for the common name. Recut through
  `reframe-photo.js` trimming ONLY from the top, which lifts the entire pod clear
  of the stats plaque while keeping the branch, stalk and full leaf structure.
  **A new `EDITION` registry**, keyed by slug like `HOLO` and `FULLART`, giving
  one card an orange-and-black treatment: a coloured edge, outlined data panels,
  a feathered background blur, and a replacement for the bottom strip's text.
  **The blur is a RENDER effect, not a photo edit — deliberately.**
  `PHOTO-REFRAME-BRIEF.md` forbids baking a background blur into a master,
  because that edits the evidence. So the file on disk stays an untouched camera
  original and the blur lives in CSS: a `backdrop-filter` behind a radial mask,
  sharp in the middle, soft at the edges. Same look, provenance intact.
  **What it costs, and why it is per-slug:** the bottom strip is the only place
  the app teaches its own core gesture, so an EDITION card no longer says
  "double tap to master". Fine once; a deck where every card is themed is a deck
  with no template.
  **Three bugs found while building it, all worth keeping:**
  1. `box-shadow` for the edge was silently beaten by `.card.hot .tcard`, which
     sets box-shadow further down the sheet. Now an `outline`, which nothing else
     touches.
  2. The replacement strip text arrived as a lone apostrophe. The value is a
     CSS string carried inside a **double-quoted HTML attribute**, and the
     literal quotation marks in it ended the attribute early. `editionStyle()`
     entity-escapes them. The HOLO block's own comment warns about exactly this;
     it was still walked into.
  3. The first cover strip was positioned inside `.band` and covered the aspect
     rail instead of the baked text, which sits in CARD coordinates.
  Verified no other card is reached: `Sango-kaku` and `Avondale` both render with
  no outline and their normal strip, and the registry holds exactly one slug.

- **v14.21 (211 dealt / 82 held)**: *Deutzia* 'Magicien' and *Magnolia
  acuminata* — **the first two cards framed with `tools/reframe-photo.js`**,
  ported onto this branch from `claude/plant-collection-scan-y2j7fp` along with
  `PHOTO-REFRAME-BRIEF.md`. Worth knowing what it changed:
  **It caught an arithmetic error of mine.** My first Magnolia crop box claimed
  `cropAspect 0.795` while its width and height actually multiplied out to
  **1.023** — outside the allowed 0.75–1.0. The tool refused to write and said
  so. Every hand-crop before this (Tetrapanax, Crinodendron, the Cercis panel,
  the Gunnera underside) happened to land inside the band, but nothing was
  checking.
  **And it needed a fix before it worked at all here: it ignored EXIF
  orientation.** `sharp` reports sensor dimensions, so a phone photo flagged
  `orientation 6` — roughly half of this project's Galaxy captures — failed with
  "wrong photo for this JSON" and a nonsense aspect, because the vision model's
  coordinates describe the *displayed* frame. It now swaps the axes for the
  checks and calls `.rotate()` before `extract()`. Fixed here rather than
  reported, since both branches share the tool.

- **v14.20 (209 dealt / 82 held)**: *Clematis* JOSEPHINE and *Sempervivum
  arachnoideum* built; *Forsythia* 'Lynwood Variety' dealt out of hold;
  MINER'S MERLOT re-photographed; **Gunnera gets the deck's third PHOTO_SWAP
  pair**, and the first where the two frames show opposite sides of the same
  leaf. ***Ophiopogon planiscapus* 'Kokuryū' was built and HELD** — no
  photograph came with it.
  **Two identifications were refused, both on seasonal evidence rather than
  taste.** The Daphne photograph is **not** the deck's held *D. bholua*
  'Jacqueline Postill': that card's own peak is Jan-Mar and its text says "in
  the depths of winter", and this plant is in full flower in mid-August with
  small narrow leaves — the *D.* × *transatlantica* summer-flowering group.
  Parked as `daphne-unidentified-summer.jpg`. And the Forsythia, though dealt on
  Oscar's naming, carries a picture its own card text contradicts. VERIFY-QUEUE 44.

- **v14.19 (206 dealt / 82 held)**: *Buddleja davidii* LITTLE RUBY. **PBR
  protected, and the card cannot say so** — its `compliance` field reads "PBR
  protected · commercial propagation restricted" and there is nowhere to render
  it. Item 0c again, and this is the *other* half of that gap: not a safety
  warning this time but a **commercial** one, on a plant a garden centre might
  otherwise propagate from its own stock. Six cards now carry PBR wording that
  no one can see.

- **v14.18 (205 dealt / 82 held)**: *Hosta* 'Emerald Charger'. Oscar's own note
  records that the supplied name 'Emerald Changer' was corrected to the accepted
  'Emerald Charger' — worth keeping, because the deck now holds three Hostas and
  two of them are near-inverse variegations. **Its `toxicity` — "Toxic to dogs
  and cats if eaten" — has nowhere to render: the tenth batch to hit item 0c**,
  and the thirteenth affected card.

- **v14.17 (204 dealt / 82 held)**: *Agapanthus* 'Ovatus' and *Veronica*
  'Emerald Gem'.
  **The deck now straddles a genus rename.** RHS has moved *Hebe* into
  *Veronica*; 'Emerald Gem' is filed as Oscar supplied it, under *Veronica*,
  while the held 'Red Edge' is still a *Hebe*. Both are defensible and the
  common names keep them findable, but **the deck should pick one convention**
  before it has six of them. VERIFY-QUEUE 43.
  **And a safety fact was dropped again, on a toxic plant.** The Agapanthus JSON
  carries `toxicity: "Harmful if eaten by humans, dogs and cats"` and the card
  schema has nowhere to put it, so **that card currently warns nobody**. This is
  the ninth batch to hit item 0c and the second time in two days it has cost a
  real toxicity warning — 'Homebush' only kept its because the older card had
  smuggled the wording into `resilience`. That workaround is available here too
  and was NOT applied unasked, because editing his researched data to route round
  a schema gap is his call, not a tool's.

- **v14.16 (the Listen button stops sounding like a robot)**: two separate faults
  were making it sound bad, and only one of them was the voice.
  **The voice.** `speakLatin` took `voices.find(en-GB)` — *the first* en-GB voice
  the device offered, which on a phone is usually the oldest one installed
  (Apple's "compact" Daniel, Android's legacy en-GB). Every modern platform also
  exposes a good neural voice through the same API. It is now scored and chosen:
  Edge's *Online (Natural)* voices (Sonia, Libby, Maisie, Ryan) rank highest,
  then Apple *Premium* and *Enhanced* (Serena, Stephanie, Kate, Jamie), then
  Google UK English, with anything named "compact" explicitly demoted.
  **What it was told to say — the bigger fault.** The button spoke `latin`
  verbatim, so **41 cards were reading their breeder code aloud**: "Magnolia
  Honey Tulip **Jurmag five**", "Oenothera lindheimeri Gaudi Rose
  **Florgaucomro**", "Cordyline australis Charlie Boy **Ric zero one**". A
  further **38 carry an all-caps trade name**, which some engines spell out
  letter by letter. A new `sayable()` drops bracketed codes and quotes, silences
  the hybrid sign, title-cases trade names, and speaks `subsp.` / `var.` / `f.`
  in full. Verified across all 284 cards: none still contains a bracket, a
  capital run or a hybrid sign after the transform.
  **Two things this cost, both worth recording.** A smoke test caught a
  `ReferenceError` I introduced — `loadVoices()` runs at boot and clears `VOICE`,
  which was declared with `let` further down, so every page load threw until the
  declaration moved up. And `app-test` went red because it carried **its own copy
  of the old transform**; it now asks the page for `sayable()` and asserts the
  guarantees (no brackets, no capital runs, no hybrid sign, still opens with the
  genus) instead of duplicating the rule. That is the same drift `NPLANTS` caused
  in four suites.
  **What this cannot do:** ChatGPT-style voices are server-side neural TTS behind
  an API key. This app is a static offline PWA on Pages with no server to keep a
  key in, so that route would mean publishing the key. The Edge *Natural* voices
  are the best thing reachable without one.

- **v14.15 (202 dealt / 82 held)**: *Houttuynia cordata* 'Pied Piper'. **Its
  `soilWarning` is doing real work** — *"Contain rhizomes · spreads
  aggressively"* — and it is worth noting that the deck now has a small set of
  cards whose warning field carries a containment or legal message (Gunnera,
  Virginia Creeper, *Rhododendron luteum*, the knotweed, and now this). That is
  the closest the schema gets to the `compliance` field it still does not have
  (item 0c, eighth batch). Houttuynia is not scheduled in the UK, but it is a
  plant that escapes, and the card says so where staff will read it.

- **v14.14 (201 dealt / 82 held)**: four new cards — *Cercis* CAROLINA
  SWEETHEART, *Elaeagnus* 'Limelight', *Acer palmatum* 'Oridono-nishiki',
  *Epimedium* 'Fröhnleiten' — plus **two held cards dealt on Oscar's word**:
  'Tom Thumb' and 'Homebush'.
  **'Homebush' is the one to read.** A researched card for it already existed in
  the hold block, and the JSON supplied with the photograph differs from it in
  **sixteen fields** — size (1.5–2.5 m against 1–1.5 m), five of the six ratings,
  aspect, soil, and the flower description itself. **The existing card was kept
  and only the photograph added.** The deciding reason is not seniority: the held
  card carries *"all parts harmful if eaten"* inside `resilience`, where the card
  can actually render it, while the new JSON moves that fact into `toxicity` —
  **a field the card schema drops** (item 0c). Applying the new version verbatim
  would have silently deleted a safety warning from a card describing a toxic
  plant. That is not a merge a tool should make quietly, so it is Oscar's call:
  VERIFY-QUEUE 42 lists every difference.

- **v14.13 (Chile Lantern Tree gets its lanterns)**: photo replaced. The old
  frame carried no flowers on a card whose text leads with them, which is the
  same class of fault the Coprosma 'Inferno' swap fixed and the *Syringa* card
  still has. **Note the crop count: this is the second source crop in the deck,
  and both were forced by the same arithmetic** — a tall narrow phone frame plus
  a long-edge cap of 1200 yields a master far narrower than the card renders.
  Worth considering whether `deal-plant.js` should cap the SHORT edge instead
  when a source is unusually tall; `add-plant.js` already caps width, which is
  why its masters come out 1200×1600. The two tools disagree, and that
  disagreement is what makes the crop necessary in one path and not the other.

- **v14.12 (195 dealt / 84 held)**: *Hibiscus syriacus* LAVENDER CHIFFON added;
  *Viburnum* × *bodnantense* 'Charles Lamont' reshot and replaced — Oscar framed
  the new one **for the card's photo window rather than for the photograph**,
  which is the first time a shot has been composed around the template.
  ***Pittosporum tenuifolium* 'Tom Thumb' was built and HELD**, not dealt: the
  photograph that arrived with it is a small-leaved pittosporum in vivid magenta
  and cream, and 'Tom Thumb' is solid purple-black with lime-green new growth. It
  is also **not** the deck's existing 'Elizabeth', whose leaves are markedly
  larger with cream margins. Photo parked as
  `pittosporum-variegated-unidentified.jpg`; VERIFY-QUEUE 41.

- **v14.11 (the perf pixel assertion is settled: gate 17/17)**: `perf-test`'s
  zero-pixel check has been given a measured tolerance — 64 px and a max
  per-pixel channel-sum of 8, against an observed 17 px / Δ5 — closing
  VERIFY-QUEUE 36 on Oscar's decision. **The bound was measured rather than
  picked:** a staged leak (one buried card un-hidden and nudged 12 px so it
  genuinely showed) diffs at 46,882 px / Δ443, so there are three orders of
  magnitude between the residual being tolerated and the defect being guarded
  against. The evidence, the bisection and that measurement all live in the
  test's own comment, and the observed numbers now appear in the check's name on
  every run so the drift stays visible instead of hiding under the threshold.

- **v14.10 (Oscar names the parked ones: 194 dealt / 83 held)** — five new cards
  and one long-refused card dealt, all on his identifications rather than mine.
  **The correction worth reading: *Syringa vulgaris* has been sent back to the
  hold block and its photograph moved to a new card.** The species card was
  built from his JSON one batch ago and dealt with a leaf photograph; he has
  since supplied the actual plant, ***S. vulgaris* 'Znamya Lenina'**. So the
  photograph was never the species' — it was the cultivar's. Rather than delete
  the species card, it goes back to hold with its research intact and no
  photograph, which is exactly what the hold block is for. `photos/
  syringa-vulgaris.jpg` and its derivative were removed and the CREDITS entry
  pruned.
  **Two parked files became cards** (`cornus-variegated-unidentified.jpg`,
  `calycanthus-unidentified.jpg`) and their parked copies were deleted so the
  same picture does not sit in `photos/` twice. **Robinia stays parked** at
  Oscar's request. **The white-plumed shrub from VERIFY-QUEUE 37 is still open.**
  **One provenance flag, stated rather than buried:** the Lilium photograph
  carries a Galaxy AI generative-edit marker and a visible AI label. Oscar asked
  for no photo checks on that card and its identification was not questioned;
  the provenance is a separate matter and is recorded in full in `CREDITS.json`
  rather than skipped. See VERIFY-QUEUE 40.

- **v14.9 (Rice-paper Plant dealt: 189 / 83)**: *Tetrapanax papyrifer* 'Rex',
  held since the wishlist batch, photographed and dealt. Moved via the
  `plants.csv` `held` flag and `plants-tool.js import` — **the first use of that
  documented path since the `pest:""` bug was fixed in v14.6**, and it round-
  tripped clean. The photograph needed a source crop for a resolution reason
  set out in the register above; that is the only cropped source in the deck and
  it should stay rare.

- **v14.8 (ten cards from Oscar's research: 188 dealt / 84 held)** — the largest
  single batch the deck has taken. All ten came with his own JSON and his own
  photographs, all clean captures.
  **One validator catch worth keeping:** `Geranium 'Bob's Blunder'` failed
  `check-plant-json` on unbalanced quotes — three straight apostrophes, because
  the possessive sits inside the cultivar epithet. Fixed to the deck's existing
  convention (straight quotes delimit the cultivar, a curly ’ for the internal
  possessive) which is what `'Wim’s Red'`, `'Baggesen’s Gold'` and
  `'Miss Jessopp’s Upright'` already do. The slug is unchanged either way.
  **Near-miss genus checks done before staging, not after:** three Hypericums,
  two gold-variegated ivies in different species, three Weigelas and four
  Loniceras now live in the deck. Every one of these was confirmed distinct.
  **Four cards are dealt on foliage-only frames** — Lonicera 'Copper Beauty',
  Clematis AVALANCHE, Weigela (partly) and *Syringa vulgaris* — because their
  flowers are out of season. That is a real gap between a card's text and its
  picture, of the same kind the Coprosma swap fixed, and it is logged rather
  than left to be rediscovered. Two further photographs were **parked**: a
  variegated red-stemmed *Cornus* and the shrub Oscar could not name, which
  reads as a *Calycanthus*. VERIFY-QUEUE 39.

- **v14.7 (one deal, three photo replacements, three parked: 178 dealt / 84 held)**:
  **'Pretty Lady Emily' is dealt** one batch after being held for want of a
  photograph — the fastest a held card has turned around. **Silver Edge, Inferno
  and Chamaerops humilis got new masters**, each with its `photos/card/*.webp`
  re-derived. The Inferno swap is worth reading as more than an upgrade: its old
  frame showed the summer state while the card text sells the winter colouring,
  so the card and its picture were describing different seasons.
  **Three photographs were parked rather than filed** — two of a spined,
  pinnate-leaved tree (Robinia, cultivar unknown) and one of a cream-variegated
  Hebe that is plainly not the deck's held 'Red Edge'. They sit in `photos/` under
  `*-unidentified-*` names, which no card slug can resolve, so they are carried
  and credited without claiming anything. VERIFY-QUEUE 38.

- **v14.6 (six cards from Oscar's research, four photographed: 177 dealt / 85 held)**:
  *Muehlenbeckia complexa*, *Astrantia major* 'Star of Love', *Salvia guaranitica*
  'Black and Blue' and *Hosta* 'Broadband' are dealt; **Anemone × hybrida 'Pretty
  Lady Emily' and *Loropetalum chinense* var. *rubrum* 'Fede' went to the hold
  block** because no photograph came with them — an empty card never sits in the
  deck. Three of the photographs sent have **no card in this batch** (a
  *Physocarpus*, a white-plumed *Astilbe*-or-*Sorbaria*, and a bronze-leaved
  *Geranium*); each one lands near a HELD card whose cultivar it does not
  obviously match, so none was staged — VERIFY-QUEUE 37.
- **A real bug was found and fixed on the way through: `plants-tool.js import`
  wrote `pest:""` onto every card that had never carried the key** — 260 of
  them — because `csvParse` gives every column a value and `'' !== undefined`.
  `check-boot.js` rejects an empty `pest` outright (it would fall through to the
  baked mite icon), so **the documented "edit plants.csv, then import" path was
  broken for the whole deck**, not just for this batch. Fixed at source with the
  reason in a comment, then verified the round-trip is lossless: all 256
  pre-existing cards compared field-by-field against the previous commit, zero
  differences. Anyone who ran an import since the `pest` field was introduced
  would have hit this.

- **v14.5 (two cards from Oscar's own research: 173)**: *Rhus typhina* 'Dissecta'
  and *Catalpa* × *erubescens* 'Purpurea', both built from JSON he supplied with
  a filled-in `uncertain` block, both photographed by him on clean captures.
  The sumach closes VERIFY-QUEUE 33 the way it recommended — a **separate card**
  for the cut-leaf form, with the plain species left held rather than given a
  photograph of the wrong leaf. What he flagged as soft is in VERIFY-QUEUE 35
  rather than silently accepted; the one worth staff's attention is the Catalpa's
  size, where RHS says 12 m+ and the card carries 10–15 m from specialist
  sources. **`add-plant.js` does not write provenance** — unlike `deal-plant.js`
  it stops at the CREDITS check with the row already inserted, so
  `photo-credits.js --set` has to follow it by hand. Worth fixing in the tool.
  **The gate on this commit is 16/17, not 17/17.** The two cards took the deck to
  173 and tripped `perf-test`'s zero-pixel assertion — 16 pixels at the deck's
  right edge differing by ONE unit in 255 on black, caused by two more `.tcard`
  shadows stacking. Bisected against the previous commit to prove it is deck
  size and not flake. **The test was deliberately left failing** rather than
  given a tolerance, because quietly loosening a gate so one's own change passes
  is the move that must never be quiet — VERIFY-QUEUE item 36 lays out the three
  options and recommends one.

- **v14.4 (Verbena dealt from the original; the composite still refused)**: Oscar
  corrected the record — he took both halves of the refused two-panel image
  himself, and the AI merged them. The refusal of *that file* stands (declared
  generated, 878px, a seam a portrait crop cannot avoid), but "AI-generated" was
  the wrong description of his underlying work and the ownership concern raised
  with it was overstated. He then sent the originals: the bee frame carries no
  C2PA manifest at all and is now on the card. Deck 170 → 171.
  **The foliage original was still not staged** — `softwareAgent: Photo assist`,
  `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`, and a visible "AI-generated content"
  label, i.e. VERIFY-QUEUE item 32's category caught before landing instead of
  after; and its leaves read as a different vervain from the card's plant.
  **The lesson worth keeping: read the credentials, then say what they say and
  no more.** They establish how a file was made. They do not establish who owns
  the work that went into it, and the first version of this refusal blurred the
  two.

- **v14.3 (an image was offered for Purple Top Verbena and refused)**: the file
  carries a signed Google C2PA chain declaring `c2pa.created` — "Created by
  Google Generative AI", `digitalSourceType: trainedAlgorithmicMedia` — plus a
  SynthID watermark and the visible sparkle glyph added as a `composite` edit.
  That is the exact marker this protocol says to refuse on sight, so
  *Verbena bonariensis* stays held and nothing was staged. Two further faults
  would each have stopped it anyway: 878×1216 px is under the 1200px floor, and
  it is a two-panel composite that a single portrait card window cannot crop
  without showing the seam. **The scan is the reason this was caught before it
  landed, not after** — read the credentials before staging, every time.
  VERIFY-QUEUE item 34.

- **v14.2 (five photos in, one refused: 170 dealt)**: Oscar sent five phone
  photographs against cards that already existed — three held, two dealt and
  wanting a better frame. **Dealt: Rosemary 'Miss Jessopp's Upright' and Coral
  Bark Maple** (deck 168 → 170, hold 86 → 84). **Replaced: Oleander and
  Corkscrew Hazel** masters, with `photos/card/*.webp` re-derived — the app
  loads ONLY the WebP (`photoSrc`), so a swapped master with a stale derivative
  changes nothing on the phone and does not fail a test. **Refused: the Stag's
  Horn Sumach**, which is the one Oscar himself asked about. It is *Rhus
  typhina* — the shoot in frame is densely hairy, and the leaf has far more
  leaflet pairs than an elder — but the leaflets are deeply cut, i.e. a
  **cut-leaf cultivar** ('Dissecta' / 'Laciniata', and much of what is sold
  under that name is now *R.* × *pulvinata* Autumn Lace Group). The held card is
  the plain species and its own `visual` line promises simple pinnate leaflets,
  so the photograph would teach the wrong leaf. Card stays held; see
  VERIFY-QUEUE item 33 — it is a naming call for Oscar, not one for me.
  All five files scanned first: Galaxy S24 captures, no C2PA or
  `trainedAlgorithmicMedia` markers, and no Galaxy AI sparkle glyph in the
  corner crops (VERIFY-QUEUE item 32's concern), so provenance is recorded as
  his own work with commercial use cleared.
- **v14.1 (menu panel scrolls — a defect that grew with the deck)**: not a card
  change, but a layout defect found by the plant work and logged here per
  CORRECTION-PROTOCOL §4.5. `.sheet .panel` was `height:100%` with no overflow
  handling while its filter chips are **generated from the deck**, so it grew with
  every plant added. At 390×844 the content reached 1098px: "Reset progress" sat
  36px below the fold and was untappable on a phone; adding Japanese Knotweed's
  ⚠ NEVER STOCK chip took it to 68px. This is why `app-test` had been failing at a
  varying line and being written off as container flakiness — Playwright's retry
  loop occasionally landed the click. Fixed at the cheapest layer (§4.2):
  `overflow-y:auto` + `overscroll-behavior:contain`, contained so the deck behind
  the sheet can never pull-to-refresh. Per §4.1 the defect is now visible to the
  suite — app-test asserts every menu row is reachable, and the assertion was
  verified failing against an unfixed copy before the fix went in. 95 checks
  (was 94); full gate 14/14.
- **v14 (ELONGATED TEMPLATE — card is now 420×600)**: Oscar wanted the card
  longer without a reckless redesign (a ChatGPT frame regen drifted: restyled
  gold, redrawn ornaments, deleted the baked master strip — rejected). Instead
  the v12 art was elongated from its own pixels: 150 art-px of plain spine/trim
  inserted into `frame-full.png` at row 323 (a measured plain window between
  the top flourish and the HEIGHT lettering), mirror-tiled in two 75px
  reflected segments so every seam is row-continuous → `art/frame-600.png`
  (1103×1576). Only trim/spine/bottom-strip are ever visible (the live photo
  covers the whole window), so interior seams don't matter. Re-anchoring rule:
  regions above the insert keep px from the TOP edge (title, crest, listen,
  growth rail), regions below keep px from the BOTTOM edge (ppp, plaque, soil,
  band, both rail values) — identical to the art shift, so every overlay still
  lands exactly on its baked twin (verified: plaque baked 0.60025 vs anchor
  60.02%). All extra height goes to the photo. Deck runtime stretch cap cut
  1.25 → 1.12 (near-invisible). Manifest v3 remapped the same way.
  `design/card-builder.html` updated in lockstep. All nine suites + layout
  audit green with zero rule changes.
- **v12.6 (soil-panel 3-line overflow fixed)**: the standing brick — a long
  hyphenated soil value ("Rich, moisture-retentive", 24 chars, under the
  validator's 26-char warning threshold) wrapped to 3 lines and its third line
  visually collided with the warning-triangle icon below (measured: 3-line
  text needs ~32.4px, only ~30.7px of clearance exists before the warning
  zone starts). Fixed by matching `.s-val-ink` to the warning text's existing
  8.5px/1.15 sizing (was 9px/1.2) — not a new invented size, reuses
  `.s-warn-ink`'s token. Confirmed on Ligularia 'Treasure Island' (the
  flagged case): now wraps to 2 clean lines with margin to spare. Shared CSS,
  applies to every card. All suites green (94 app + 8 edge + sw-update).
- **v12.5 (matching wooden edging on all parchment boxes)**: Oscar: the aspect
  band had a nice thin wooden edging but the Plant Power Points plaque and the
  SOIL box didn't — the card wasn't cohesive. Fixed in the assets so every card
  gets it automatically: the band's rim profile was pixel-measured from
  `art/band-full.png` (dark outline → 2–3px lit gold → 1px dark inner line →
  parchment) and baked onto `art/plaque-full.png` and `art/soil-full.png` by
  `design/bake-rim.py` (erosion bands traced from each asset's own alpha
  contour, so the rim hugs the rounded corners; deterministic + idempotent).
  All three boxes now carry the same rim at the same on-card scale. Suites
  green, layout audit clean.
- **v12.5 (value-patch label bleed fixed)**: Oscar flagged Bloom and Care Level
  specifically as having "an overly dramatic paper effect covering" the words,
  and asked whether it was a card-piecing issue and whether the patch outline
  needed trimming. Measured (not eyeballed) the baked label/value ink bands in
  `art/plaque-full.png` by luminance-thresholding each row's text column: the
  live-value cover patches (`.p-bloom-val`, `.p-pest-val`, `.p-care-val`) all
  started above their own row's label bottom edge, so the flat parchment patch
  was painting over the tail of the baked label text before the live value
  drew on top — worst on Care Level (14px overlap) and Bloom (14px), smaller on
  Pests (8px), and confirmed zero overlap on Thirst (which is why Oscar never
  flagged that row). Fixed by lowering each patch's `top` and shrinking its
  `height` by the same amount, keeping the previously-unchanged bottom edge so
  value-text coverage isn't reduced. Verified on a blank-rating card (label
  crispness, card-agnostic) and on the Callistemon card's real two-line Care
  value ("Moderate" + "2.25/5", the tallest case) — clean, no clipping. This is
  a shared-CSS change, so it applies to every card, old and new, automatically.
  App (94), edge (8) and sw-update suites green; `design/verify-cards.js` was
  not re-run since it targets the separate `design/card-builder.html`
  prototype, not `timber.html`'s live `renderCard()` — unaffected by this fix.
- **v12.4b (leader-tick remnant erased)**: verifying the sun fix across all seven
  bands side-by-side made the last accepted blemish untenable — the baked
  wiggle-leader's tip peeked between the pointer-cover patch and the bar as a
  1–2px tick at ~85% on every card. Clone-stamped out of `art/band-full.png`
  (bar columns copied from 11px left). All seven bands now carry only their own
  data-driven marks. Suites green.
- **v12.4 (sun repositioned to the sun end + one-command pipeline)**: Oscar: the
  band's sun icon sat washed-out at the wrong place — it should be tiny and
  directly parallel at the *sun end* of the shade→sun bar, adjacent to it, or gone.
  Root cause found: the painted sun sits LEFT of the bar (the shade side,
  semantically backwards) and its pale golds are genuinely low-contrast. Fixed in
  the assets, so it's correct on every card automatically: the sun was cut from the
  painted band as a radial-feathered chip (colour-keying failed — too close to
  parchment, which is *why* it looked faded), its old position inpainted to clean
  parchment (glow included; first attempt left a smudge), and the chip re-placed at
  12px, centred on the bar line just right of its end cap (94.4% band). A generic
  `.band>img{width:100%}` rule was silently stretching the chip to a 292px smear —
  scoped override added. Verified on all 7 cards; suites green.
  **Pipeline de-slopped**: `tools/add-plant.js` is now the whole routine in one
  command (validate → photo → row → test counts → both suites → screenshot),
  tested end-to-end in a sandboxed repo copy (8-plant deck, 94/94 + 8/8 green,
  correct card screenshot). Validator gained soil-length overflow warnings after
  the test card showed a 3-line soil value grazing the warning triangle.

- **v12.42 (Winter Beauty Honeysuckle — photo mismatch, first populated
  toxicity)**: pre-converted schema. **Two supplied photos, neither usable**:
  one was a water lily (Nymphaea — wrong plant entirely), the other a tuxedo cat
  in front of the Lonicera (the nursery label 'Lonicera Winter Beauty' in-shot
  confirms the ID, but the plant is blocked; a foliage crop was weak backlit
  summer leaves and misses the point — Winter Beauty is bought for scented cream
  winter flowers on BARE stems). Refused to stage the water lily (reality
  filter) and shipped on the **gradient fallback** with verified data instead —
  needs a proper winter shot. Also **first JSON with a populated `toxicity`
  field** ("Fruit harmful if eaten · wear gloves") — surfaced in resilience
  (no toxicity render yet; another argument for the toxicity/compliance display
  build). Dec–Mar bloom (valuable winter-scent gap-filler). Gate green: 94/94,
  8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.41 (Big Blue Sea Holly — FIRST populated compliance field)**: pre-
  converted schema + real photo. **First plant to carry a non-empty
  `compliance` value**: "PBR protected · propagation rights restricted" (Plant
  Breeders' Rights — propagating 'Myersblue' for resale needs a licence).
  Lower severity than Gunnera (sale ban) or Olive (Xylella) — a trade note, not
  a customer safety issue — so surfaced on the **trade back** (type +
  returnRisk), no front warning. This is the concrete trigger for a **tiered
  compliance display**: three cards now carry compliance data at two severity
  levels (legal-ban/biosecurity = front flag; PBR = back-only note). Recommend
  building it next — the `compliance` field now feeds it directly. Records:
  **sunNeed 98 (new deck max** — sea holly wants blazing sun), thirst 3
  (near drought-proof). Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.40 (Honey Tulip Magnolia)**: pre-converted schema + real photo. First
  **trade-name-with-cultivar-code latin** on the card (Magnolia HONEY TULIP
  ('Jurmag5')) — renders fine in the subtitle, slugs to
  magnolia-honey-tulip-jurmag5. A yellow magnolia (goblet honey-yellow flowers)
  — species/cultivar consistent with Oscar's in-hand photo. growth 6 (slow,
  magnolias take years), container "no" (a 4 m tree), Mar-Apr bloom (early —
  frost-vulnerable, kept the caveat). Fourth flower-in-hand shot handled by
  focusing off the hand. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.39 (Hot Lips Sage — first JSON with the new toxicity + compliance
  fields)**: Oscar updated the ChatGPT prompt per the v12.38 feedback, and this
  JSON is the first to arrive with dedicated **`toxicity` and `compliance`
  fields** (both empty here — correctly, Hot Lips is neither toxic nor
  restricted). They're captured but **not yet rendered** on the card — when a
  future plant populates them, that's the hook for the parked compliance-ribbon
  + a toxicity row (the fields now exist to drive them cleanly instead of
  improvising into soilWarning/resilience). Second Salvia in the deck (with
  'Blue Spire'), distinct slug. Real photo; the red + red/white bicolour lipped
  flowers confirm the cultivar (Hot Lips' blooms shift colour with temperature).
  Clean pass. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.38 (Bloodgood Japanese Maple)**: pre-converted schema + cutout, hero-on-
  self (hue 350). Second Acer palmatum in the deck — the dark red-purple
  'Bloodgood' paired with the autumn-scarlet 'Ōsakazuki', distinct slug. Single
  dramatic leaf composited on the dark ground. growth 5 (slow, matches Acer
  palmatum anchor). Clean pass, nothing to relocate — pre-converted format
  continues to run straight through. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier,
  audit clean.
- **v12.37 (Common Olive — a second biosecurity flag)**: pre-converted schema +
  cutout, hero-on-self (hue 75). **Xylella note kept on the FRONT card**
  ("Shelter from frost · Xylella high-risk host" in the soil warning) — olive is
  a top-tier host of Xylella fastidiosa, a notifiable quarantine pathogen that
  garden centres genuinely watch under plant-health/passport rules, so unlike a
  care preference this is a material trade fact worth front-and-centre. Second
  biosecurity-flagged card after Gunnera (v12.21) — reinforces the case for the
  parked compliance-ribbon design. Data: sunNeed 95 (ties lavender for sunniest),
  thirst 4 (drought-lover), single-facing South, H4. growth 5 (slow). Gate
  green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.36 (Wedding Cake Tree — deck reaches 40 plants)**: pre-converted schema
  + real photo. Cornus controversa 'Variegata' — the tiered "wedding cake"
  architectural specimen; second Cornus in the deck (with Flower Tower), distinct
  slug. Cream-margined arcuate-veined leaves confirm it. growth 6 (slow, as this
  choice specimen is), container "no" (a 4–8 m tree), pest 5 (trouble-free).
  Focus set left (42%) to keep the background nursery pot/paving out of the
  visible band. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean. **Deck
  milestone: 40 plants, every one photographed and audited.**
- **v12.35 (Musa basjoo — the deck's extremes card)**: pre-converted schema +
  cutout, hero-on-self. The hardy banana sets several deck records: **growth 18
  (fastest — near-rampant suckering), thirst 16 and careLevel 15** (needs
  feeding, watering and winter crown-wrapping), **first single-facing "South"
  aspect** (it needs the warmest wall). H2 tender — the leaves are botanically
  evergreen but frost-shredded outdoors in the UK (kept Oscar's caveat; peak
  Jun-Oct is the foliage display). A nursery barcode tag in the source cutout
  falls below the visible band (hidden under the plaque — QA "labels not
  dominant" satisfied by focus 50% 20%). Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier,
  audit clean.
- **v12.34 (Ōsakazuki Japanese Maple — a macron/diacritic slug fix)**: pre-
  converted schema + real photo (palmate leaves + red petioles confirm Acer
  palmatum). Exposed a slug bug: the macron **Ō** is non-ASCII, so the old
  slug fn collapsed 'Ōsakazuki' to `sakazuki` (dropping the o entirely).
  Fixed `slugLatin` (and the matching computations in check-plant-json.js and
  audit-layout.js — all three kept identical) to fold diacritics first
  (`NFD` normalize + strip combining marks), so ō→o → `acer-palmatum-osakazuki`.
  Handles any future macron cultivar (Shōjō, Ōgon…). Existing ASCII slugs are
  unaffected. The Ō renders correctly in the card title/subtitle. growth 5
  (Acer palmatum is famously slow, matches the rubric anchor), autumn colour
  Oct-Nov (§4b). Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.33 (Horizon Monarch Rhododendron)**: pre-converted schema + cutout,
  hero-on-self (hue 48). thirst 14 (rhododendrons need constant moisture),
  shade-tolerant (sunNeed 45, sunMin 25), H4. The soil is **acid/ericaceous —
  a genuine hard requirement** (rhododendrons fail on alkaline/limey soil), so
  I flagged it in confidence as a real customer point, not a mere preference.
  Photo is species-consistent foliage + a developing flower bud (no open
  yellow truss). Kept the Hillier 'Planter'-format caveat. Gate green: 94/94,
  8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.32 (Gold Rider Leyland Cypress — a nothogenus checker fix)**: pre-
  converted schema + cutout, hero-on-self (hue 55). Exposed a checker bug: the
  latin starts with the intergeneric hybrid sign **× Cuprocyparis** (a
  nothogenus), which the "must start with a capitalised genus" rule wrongly
  rejected. Fixed the rule to allow a leading `× ` — handles any future
  intergeneric hybrid. **First conifer in the deck.** growth 15 (fast — it's
  Leyland, though 'Gold Rider' is a shade tamer than the rampant green species
  at 20), sunNeed 90 (gold colour needs sun), container "no" (only card so far
  that can't go in a pot — a 25 m tree). Renders the × correctly in the card
  subtitle. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.31 (Jenny Japanese Holly)**: pre-converted schema + real photo. Ilex
  crenata — the box-blight-safe substitute for Buxus, sold clipped as bush/ball/
  pyramid. Third clip-and-shape evergreen alongside the two Euonymus (topiary
  cluster forming in the deck). Evergreen (peak Jan-Dec), growth 6 (slow, as
  clipped topiary should be), PBR cultivar caveat kept. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8,
  SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.30 (Green Spire Japanese Spindle — deck's first cultivar pair)**: pre-
  converted schema + real photo. Second Euonymus japonicus in the deck — the
  plain-green upright 'Green Spire' (topiary/ball form) alongside the earlier
  gold-margined 'Aureomarginatus'; distinct latin-slugs so no photo collision.
  Evergreen (peak Jan-Dec, all cells lit), narrow columnar (spread 0.1–0.5 m,
  narrowest in the deck), pestRisk 9 (spindle mildew/vine weevil). Kept the
  retail-'bol'-suffix caveat. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.29 (Meyer's Lemon — first edible/citrus card)**: pre-converted schema +
  cutout, hero-on-self (hue 45). First edible-fruit card. H2 (tender — needs a
  frost-free winter indoors, correct for citrus in the UK), careLevel 14 (joint-
  highest with the Plumbago — citrus are demanding: feeding, overwintering, pest
  vigilance). Kept the Kew synonymy caveat (C. × meyeri sunk under C. × limon).
  Photo is genus-consistent glossy foliage; no fruit so cultivar unverifiable.
  Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.28 (French Lavender 'Anouk Deluxe Purple' — sunniest card in the deck)**:
  pre-converted schema + cutout, hero-on-self (hue 275). The rabbit-ear bracts
  atop the flower heads confirm Lavandula stoechas (French/Spanish lavender, vs
  English L. angustifolia). **sunNeed 95 / sunMin 80 — the most sun-demanding
  card yet**, marker hard right; thirst 4 (drought-lover). H4 — the tender
  French lavender, correctly a notch softer than hardy English types. Clean
  pass. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.27 (Orange Victory Itoh Peony)**: pre-converted schema + real photo.
  The photo's red semi-woody stems + divided leaflets confirm an Itoh
  (intersectional) peony — herbaceous peonies die to the ground, Itohs keep
  woody-based stems. growth 5 (peonies are famously slow to establish, honest),
  sunNeed 88. Kept the plant's own caveats (no cultivar-specific RHS/APS
  profile, hardiness inferred from comparable Itohs). Clean pass. Gate green:
  94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.26 (Laurustinus 'Eve Price' — deck reaches 30 plants)**: pre-converted
  schema + cutout, hero-on-self (hue 330). Winter bloomer (Dec–Apr, useful
  off-season colour), the metallic blue-purple berries in the photo are
  species-confirming. pestRisk 9 (viburnum beetle is the real risk — honest).
  Clean pass, nothing to relocate — the pre-converted JSON format is now
  reliably the smoothest path. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit
  clean. **Deck milestone: 30 plants, every one photographed and audited.**
- **v12.25 (Cascading Moth Orchid — first houseplant / H1b / full-year bloom)**:
  pre-converted schema + cutout, hero-on-self. Firsts: **H1b hardiness** (heated
  glasshouse — the tenderest crest in the deck, correct for an indoor orchid);
  **peak Jan-Dec = all 12 calendar cells lit** (Phalaenopsis flowers year-round
  indoors, spikes last months). Hue call: the JSON defaulted hue to 120 (foliage)
  because "flower colour was not supplied" — but the photo shows cream-yellow
  petals with vivid magenta lips, so I overrode to 320 magenta and the backdrop
  now matches the bloom (a case where the photo beats the JSON's own stated
  uncertainty). careLevel 9, sunNeed 45 (bright indirect). Kept the Pulsatio
  supplier-brand caveat. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.24 (Himalayan Indigo 'Silk Road' — first pre-converted JSON in the
  Timber schema)**: Oscar's JSON arrived already in the exact PLANTS schema
  (0–20 ratings, sunNeed 0–100, prune/water split correctly, foliage/container
  fields) — no conversion or field-splitting needed, first of the batch like
  this. Converted mechanically. pestRisk 3 is a genuine 0–20 value (0.75/5), the
  checker's ×4 heuristic warning is a false positive here. sunMin 80 — narrow,
  sun-demanding tolerance. Real photo, focus high (55% 15%) to skip the blurred
  garden foreground. Kept the plant's own `uncertain` notes (name status
  unresolved at RHS, flowering/spread source variance) as honest caveats. Gate
  green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.23 (Spider's Web Fatsia + Griselinia — two cutouts; an apostrophe bug)**:
  both cutouts, hero-on-self. The Fatsia exposed a **cultivar-apostrophe bug**:
  the selling name 'Spider's Web' has an apostrophe that (a) fails the checker's
  quote-balance test and (b) slugs to `spider-s-web`, not `spiders-web` (the
  JSON id) — so no filename would ever match. Resolved the botanically-correct
  way per CARD-STATS §5: the card's latin uses the true cultivar epithet
  'Tsumugi-shibori' (Japanese, no apostrophe); 'Spider's Web' is recorded as the
  English selling name in the common name + cvs. Photo staged under the correct
  latin-slug. Fatsia data: growth 0.3→6 (joint-slowest), **sunMin 5 — most
  shade-tolerant card in the deck** (deep-shade architectural evergreen), autumn
  drumstick flowers. Griselinia: growth 0.74→15 (fast coastal hedge), sunNeed 88,
  salt/wind tolerance added to resilience (littoralis = 'of the shore'). Both
  soil warnings split (siting/toxicity/care tips out of the soil field as usual).
  Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.22 (October Glory Red Maple — a bloom-months judgment call)**: from
  nested JSON + Oscar's photo (red petioles confirm A. rubrum). **Changed the
  bloom months**: the JSON gave [3,4] (the small spring flowers), but the tree's
  entire selling point is October scarlet and §4b says highlight the main
  DISPLAY not the flowers — so peak = Oct-Nov. Flagged for Oscar to veto. Data:
  thirst 14 (needs moisture for best colour), pestRisk 10, growth 0.58→12, H6,
  sunNeed 84. Soil warning split (alkaline/wet kept; dryness → Thirst; coastal
  wind kept, space implied by 15–18 m size). Second soil-VALUE overflow in three
  cards ("Moist, acidic to neutral, well-drained", 38 chars) — trimmed to
  "acid–neutral" and tightened the checker soil threshold 38→36. Gate green
  after fix: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.21 (Gunnera — FIRST COMPLIANCE/LEGAL CARD, needs a design decision)**:
  the JSON carried a new **`compliance` block**: Gunnera manicata is UK-
  restricted (invasive-species law) and most plants sold as manicata are the
  banned hybrid G. ×cryptica — do not sell/propagate/plant without verified ID.
  **No card field renders compliance.** Interim handling: headline surfaced in
  `resilience` + `type` ("⚠ UK RESTRICTED — verify ID before any sale") and the
  full warning in `returnRisk`, so it renders on the **trade back** (verified in
  screenshot); the full block is preserved in the plant JSON. **The FRONT card
  shows no legal warning** — for a customer-facing "learn plants" deck that's a
  real gap. OPEN DECISION for Oscar: (a) add a front compliance ribbon/banner
  (design change — a red corner flag when a plant has compliance data), (b)
  keep it back-only as now, or (c) hold restricted plants out of the public
  deck entirely. Recommend (a) — the card's value here is precisely as a "DO
  NOT SELL" staff reference. Ratings: **thirst 20 — first max-thirst card**
  (bog/waterside), care 16, growth 0.82→16. `[Unverified]` current exact legal
  status — the JSON asserts it and it matches known GB invasive-species listings
  c.2023–24; defer to official RHS/DEFRA guidance for the live position. This is
  also the first plant carrying a compliance field at all — CARD-STATS should
  gain a compliance section if more arrive. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW,
  verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.20 (Ebbinge's Silverberry)**: from nested JSON + Oscar's photo (silver
  scurf = confirmed ×ebbingei). Naming: card uses the current RHS name
  ×submacrophylla, the familiar ×ebbingei kept in cvs alongside the variegated
  forms (Gilt Edge / Limelight). growth 0.76→15.2 rounded to 15 (fast). Autumn
  bloomer (Oct–Nov, tiny fragrant flowers). Soil warning split again: wet+chalk
  kept (real soil constraints), hedge trim → prune. Wind/coastal tolerance +
  nitrogen fixing added to resilience (well-established Elaeagnus traits). Gate
  green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.19 (Common Hornbeam — the deck's biggest plant)**: from nested JSON +
  Oscar's leaf photo (pleated corrugated leaves = textbook Carpinus). H7 (joint-
  hardiest with Ajuga/Potentilla), and by far the **largest — 15–25 m**. The
  JSON's soil warning bundled three things: siting for a large tree (kept —
  genuine constraint), establishment watering (→ Thirst) and hedge clipping
  (→ prune). growth 0.66→13.2 rounded to 13. Apr–May "bloom" = catkins, real
  interest is foliage + hop-like seeds (§4b). Named upright forms (Fastigiata /
  Frans Fontaine) in cvs — relevant since the species itself is too big for
  most gardens. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.18 (Bubblegum Blast Bee Balm — back to a real photo)**: first non-cutout
  in a while. Data: thirst 14 (Monarda sulks if dry), pestRisk 8 (mildew-prone —
  the leaves in Oscar's own photo show early spotting), growth 0.58→12, H5.
  The JSON's soil warning again mixed a moisture regime ("do not let dry out" →
  Thirst) with mildew airflow (kept as a real siting constraint); soilWarning
  trimmed to the two genuine constraints. Pollinator note → resilience. The
  audit caught a 2px soil-VALUE overflow ("Fertile, humus-rich, moist but
  well-drained", 43 chars) that slipped under the checker's old 45-char soil
  threshold — trimmed "Fertile," (redundant with humus-rich) and tightened the
  checker threshold to 38 so it flags at source next time. Gate green after the
  fix: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.17 (Golden Japanese Spindle + a photo-slug audit rule)**: fourth
  cutout, hero-on-self (hue 50). Exposed a real bug: I staged the photo under
  the JSON **id** (`euonymus-japonicus-elegantissimus-aureus`) but the renderer
  derives the photo slug from the **latin** name
  (`euonymus-japonicus-aureomarginatus`), so the card shipped on the gradient
  fallback with the leaf watermark showing. The checker had printed the correct
  path; I didn't follow it. Fixed the filename + PHOTO_FOCUS key, and added
  audit rule **E (focus-photo)**: every PHOTO_FOCUS key must be a current
  plant's latin-slug with a file on disk — catches id-vs-latin drift without
  flagging secondary source photos or out-of-deck photos. Data: growth 0.55→11
  (exact), pestRisk 12 (spindle is vine-weevil/mildew prone), evergreen so the
  "Bloom" cell marks the minor Jun–Jul flowers while the real draw is the gold
  foliage (§4b). Reverted-shoot removal kept as a care note in the warning,
  toxicity → resilience. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.16 (Cape Leadwort — H2 tender, hero-on-self cutout)**: third cutout,
  hero-on-self composite in blue (hue 215). Data: **H2 — most tender card in
  the deck** (crest correctly shows it; needs frost-free overwintering),
  careLevel 14 (highest so far — tender lifting + pruning), sunNeed 94 (joint
  with Buddleja/Salvia), growth 0.68→13.6 rounded to 14. The JSON's soil
  warning bundled three things — frost-tenderness (kept as the soil/siting
  warning), sap irritation + toxicity (moved to resilience). syn. capensis in
  cvs. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.15 (Flamingo Willow — hero-on-self cutout treatment)**: second cutout
  input. Oscar's brief: "the background is too over the top, maybe darken it,
  then slap this back boy on top in full colour." Built `composite-hero.js`:
  a darkened + blurred + enlarged copy of the cutout as an ambient backdrop
  over a dark hue-130 base, then the sharp full-colour cutout on top. Result
  melts into the card's dark frame with no cutout seam — now the preferred
  treatment for busy-background cutouts (flat-gradient composite still fine
  for clean specimens like the Buddleja). Data: growth 0.8→16 (exact, joint-
  fastest with Ajuga), thirst 16 + pestRisk 12 (willows are thirsty and
  mite/rust prone — highest-maintenance card so far), H5, "Bloom" cell marks
  the pink-FOLIAGE season Mar–Apr not flowers (§4b). Pruning instruction in
  the soil warning again (5th) — moved to prune. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW,
  verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.14 (Pugster Orchid Buddleja + Mahonia photo staged)**: Mahonia's real
  photo arrived (spiny pinnate leaflets, bronze new shoot) — swapped off the
  gradient fallback. Buddleja is the first **cutout** input: a transparent-
  background specimen PNG, not a garden photo. Rather than flatten to black,
  composited onto the card's own hue-315 fallback gradient (design uses the
  same formula) so it reads as an intentional botanical plate; raw cutout
  kept as -cutout.png. Data: growth 0.55→11 (exact), pestRisk 10 (Buddleja
  earns it — spider mite prone), sunNeed 88, H6, Jun–Oct. Pruning instruction
  again lived in the JSON's soil warning ("Cut back to 20–25 cm") — moved to
  prune (4th time this batch; source-prompt fix still pending). Butterfly/bee
  nectar note added to resilience. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier,
  audit clean.
- **v12.13 (Japanese Mahonia + Golden Lanterns Leycesteria — first wrong-photo
  catch)**: the photo sent with the Mahonia JSON showed soft wavy golden
  red-rimmed leaves and claret hanging bracts — not a mahonia. Flagged
  instead of staged (QA rule: photo must be the plant); Oscar confirmed it
  was Leycesteria 'Golden Lanterns' and supplied its JSON. Mahonia shipped
  photo-less on the gradient fallback (first live fallback card) — photo
  pending. Mahonia: H5, sunNeed 28 (most shade-loving card), **sunMin 0**
  (leader at the bar start, flip rule exercised), Nov–Mar calendar wraps
  year-end, berry toxicity moved from soil warning to resilience.
  Leycesteria: H4, growth 0.68→13.6 rounded to 14, pests 0.5/5→2, trade
  name on card + 'Notbruce' (registered) in cvs, same berry-warning
  treatment. Both JSONs' soil warnings carried non-soil content (toxicity)
  — recurring pattern in the nested-JSON prompt worth fixing at source.
  Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.12 (Blue Spire Russian Sage)**: from nested JSON + Oscar's photo
  (dissected grey foliage + felted stems + breaking violet buds — species
  confirmed, flowers in shot). Conversions per v12.2 (growth 0.58→11.6
  rounded to 12; pestRisk 4, thirst 6, careLevel 8, sunNeed 94 — highest
  sun marker in the deck, sunMin 72). Field correction: the JSON's soil
  warning carried a pruning instruction ("Cut stems back hard in early
  spring") — moved to `prune` per CARD-STATS §4e/§6 rules (warning must be
  a soil constraint), first live use of the prune field from the nested
  pipeline. Latin uses the current RHS name Salvia 'Blue Spire'; Perovskia
  synonym in cvs. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.11 (Portuguese Laurel 'Angustifolia')**: from nested JSON + Oscar's
  photo (red stems confirm the species). Naming call: card carries the selling
  name 'Angustifolia' (matches the JSON's own id/slug); the JSON's
  botanicalName 'Myrtifolia' (accepted name) + syn. 'Pyramidalis' recorded in
  cvs — Oscar to confirm what his labels carry. Conversions per v12.2 (growth
  0.58→11.6 rounded to 12; pestRisk 10, thirst 10, careLevel 8, sunNeed 66,
  sunMin 30 — widest tolerance leader yet). First single-month bloom card
  (peak "Jun" → one calendar cell; parser handles it). soilWarning condensed:
  "ripe fruit may also be harmful if bitter" → "fruit harmful if eaten" —
  slightly stronger than source, flagged. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW,
  verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.10 (Chinese Redbud 'Avondale')**: from nested JSON + Oscar's leaf
  photo. Conversions per v12.2 (growth 0.42→8.4 rounded to 8; rest exact:
  pestRisk 8, thirst 12, careLevel 10, sunNeed 78, sunMin 52). H5, S/W
  facing, Apr–May calendar. soilWarning lightly trimmed ("Plant in a
  sheltered position" → "Plant sheltered") to fit the panel — meaning
  unchanged, flagged in the JSON's uncertain list. Photo is leaf-only
  (July shot of an April bloomer) — registered like the Cornus. First card
  through the full corrected pipeline (audit gate + label-safe patches +
  fitInk) with zero violations on first render. Gate green: 94/94, 8/8,
  SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.9 (blurred-labels fix + Nandina photo & ratings)**: Oscar reported
  "strange blur" on the bottoms of Bloom/Care etc. Measured cause: the plaque's
  value patches reached up into the baked label rows, laying feathered
  parchment over the text. Label rows luminance-measured in plaque-full.png
  (Bloom 9.0–12.3%, diseases →38.8%, Thirst →59.2%, Care Level →79.6%);
  patches re-cut to start below their labels with a tight 2px top feather
  (`.patch.lbl`), heights extended to keep the baked painted values fully
  covered (no ghosting). New audit rule: no plaque patch may intersect the
  measured label rows (x<36%; widget patches exempt). Nandina: Oscar's photo
  staged + ratings merged into the legacy row from his JSON (1→pestRisk 4,
  2.5→thirst 10, 2→careLevel 8, growth 0.44→8.8 rounded to 9, sunNeed 72,
  sunMin 40). Kept as-is pending Oscar's call — his JSON conflicts with the
  row's settled data: aspect (JSON E/W vs row "S/W best for colour"), bloom
  (JSON Jun–Jul flowers vs Sep–Feb berry display per §4b's own example), and
  soil (JSON adds shelter + toxicity; row shows legacy "· Adaptable" as its
  warning). Fixed en route: photo imgs now `pointer-events:none` — the top
  deck card had never had a photo before, and a visible img intercepted
  swipe/undo pointer events (caught by app-test, 4 failures). Potentilla
  photo re-sent this session is the identical file — no change. Gate green:
  94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.8 (layout correction pass + the audit gate)**: Oscar spotted three
  layout defects from his phone: long facings overwriting the band artwork,
  "wiggle room" written over the painted sun, and the growth diamond a hair
  off its rail. Built `design/audit-layout.js` (measures every card: ink fits
  its zone, band collisions, rail alignment, nothing leaks the card) — the
  pre-fix baseline logged **31 violations across 8 cards**, including two
  nobody had seen: every rated card's Pests/Thirst value overflowed its box
  2px (`.pval` line-height), and long soil warnings overflowed their zone
  (Potentilla by 29px — **correction: v12.7's claim that it "fits with 16.6px
  clearance" was wrong; that measurement compared the wrong container**).
  Fixes: `.pval` line-height 1; `fitInk()` auto-shrink for overflowing ink;
  aspect box widened 14.5%→25.5%; **sun icon relocated to the sun end**
  (Oscar's call — extracted `art/sun-icon.png`, painted sun + divider covered,
  divider redrawn in CSS, exposed a `.band>img` cascade collision that blew
  the sprite to full band width, now an audit rule); wiggle label flips right
  of its leader when it would cross the light zone's left edge; diamond
  rendered with −0.8px sprite-bias compensation (alpha bbox 7..40/44px,
  measured). Insulation: audit added to the standing five-suite gate
  (tests/README, NEW-SESSION), checker warns on soil >45 / soilWarning >60
  chars, full procedure + defect log in **CORRECTION-PROTOCOL.md**. Deferred:
  `design/card-builder.html` still has the old band (see protocol §5).
  Gate green: 94/94, 8/8, SW, verifier, audit clean.
- **v12.7 (Pink Beauty Potentilla)**: from nested JSON + Oscar's photo. All
  conversions exact (0.5/5→pestRisk 2 — second live half-icon card; growth
  0.5→10). H7. First live "Any aspect" card from the nested-JSON pipeline —
  compass correctly muted, no facing invented. Photo flagged: blooms shot
  near-white (documented heat fade of this cultivar; July heat spell) —
  photo-colour honesty flag, same class as Sweet Cupcake's. Long soil warning
  measured against its panel: fits with 16.6px clearance (checked, not
  eyeballed). syn. 'Lovely Pink' recorded in cvs. Suites green: 94/94, 8/8,
  SW PASS, verifier PASS.
- **v12.6 (Double Play Doozie Spirea — v3 two-photo merge goes live)**: Oscar
  supplied the nested JSON + two of his own photos, asking for a clean in-frame
  leaf with the flowers merged in. First live use of the v3 merge recipe:
  leaf photo full-bleed (cropped to the 0.77 card-window ratio) + the sharp
  bud cluster from the flower photo soft-windowed in with a feathered ellipse
  (~46%×26% at 55% 38% — positioned for the v12 card's clear zone rather than
  v3's "band above the Water box", which no longer exists). Both source photos
  staged alongside the merged file per the Agastache precedent. Conversions
  per v12.2; growthSpeed 0.58→11.6 rounded to 12. Flag: supplied JSON labels
  thirst "Average" but rates 2/5 (→8/20, low-average) — number taken as
  authority. Suites green: 94/94, 8/8, SW PASS, verifier PASS.
- **v12.5 (Burgundy Glow Ajuga — the remade-image test)**: Oscar supplied the
  nested JSON + an AI-remade full card image to test whether a remade image
  helps. Verdict: **as data, it drifts — as a photo source, it's usable.** The
  remade card contradicted the JSON on five fields (title 'Pink Lightning' vs
  'Burgundy Glow', H6 vs H7, spread 30–45 cm vs 0.5–1 m, thirst 2/5 vs 3/5,
  bloom M–J–J vs May–Jun, plus aspect/soil text) — the same drift failure as
  regenerated master docs, so the standing rule held: JSON outranks the image
  everywhere. The image's clean photo region was cropped out (card furniture
  excluded) and staged as the card photo; flagged in the register as AI
  artwork of an unverifiable cultivar at 680px (below the 1200px standard).
  Conversions per v12.2; growthSpeed 0.78→15.6 rounded to 16 (first non-exact
  conversion). Suites green: 94/94, 8/8, SW PASS, verifier PASS.
- **v12.4 (Flower Tower Dogwood — first card from the new nested-JSON shape)**:
  Oscar supplied a nested card JSON (0–5 ratings, 0–1 scale values) + his leaf
  photo. Converted per the v12.2 rule: pests 1.5→pestRisk 6, thirst 3→12, care
  2.5→careLevel 10, growth 0.55→11, light 0.78→sunNeed 78, tolerated floor
  0.48→sunMin 48. H6 per the JSON. Latin follows the Sweet Cupcake precedent
  (trade name in quotes, registered 'Zuilb1' in cvs). hue 150 is an editorial
  pick (Choisya white-flower precedent) — the JSON carries no hue. water/prune/
  resilience/uses left blank (not in the JSON; blank is honest). checker PASS,
  zero warnings. Test hygiene: edge-test.js and app-test.js had the deck size
  hardcoded as literal 7s — both now use a real `NPLANTS` const (NEW-SESSION.md
  already claimed they did). Suites green: 94/94, 8/8, SW PASS, verifier PASS.
- **v12.3 (growth label on the rail + Raspberry Profusion Abelia)**: Oscar: the
  vertical GROWTH SPEED text "was meant to be like inside the line… it's now
  outside the line". Correct — the painted rail breaks and the label runs *through*
  the axis path. Fixed: label centred on the axis centreline (measured offset now
  0.0px) and letter-spacing tightened 3px→1.5px so its height matches the painted
  label exactly (206→285.6 vs the reference's 206→285.7 in card units), which also
  stops it colliding with the lower tick stub. Abelia added from its plant JSON —
  first live card with a **half-icon rating** (pestRisk 2/20 → 0.5/5, one half-filled
  spray bottle) and a real South / West facing. Photo is Oscar's own and correctly
  shows the pink tubular bells with raspberry sepals. Suites green: 94/94, 8/8, SW.
- **v12.2 (Sweet Cupcake Hydrangea — first card built from an external JSON spec)**:
  Oscar supplied a ChatGPT-generated plant JSON + a v5 master doc + his own photo,
  asking whether the locked-template docs still help. Verdict recorded: **the JSON
  fact payload is genuinely useful** (sourced ranges, notes, toxicity — it converts
  mechanically to our schema: 0–5 ratings ×4 → our 0–20, 0–1 scale values ×100/×20),
  but **regenerating the whole master doc each time causes drift** — the v5 doc
  re-introduced light tolerance/optimal *bands* that the locked template (§18.2)
  had already removed, and still carried an uncalibrated `cardAspectRatio: 0.8`
  (measured: 0.774). Rule going forward: **send the plant JSON, not a new master
  doc**; CARD-STATS.md + the calibrated manifest are the authority.
  The build exposed and fixed two real renderer bugs: `extractFacing()` only
  matched letter aspects (`S/W`) so "East / West" silently fell back to "Any
  aspect" — now parses full words and orders them N/E/S/W; and `splitSoil()` cut
  at the first comma, mangling "Moist, fertile, humus-rich" — now splits on
  `;`/`·` or a comma only before an instruction word. Soil value wraps to two
  lines. This is also the first card to exercise a real compass facing and the
  wiggle-room leader together. Test suites moved out of scratchpad into `tests/`
  (they were lost on every container restart); `tests/README.md` documents the run
  order. Suites green: 94/94, 8/8, SW PASS, card verifier PASS.
- **v12.1 (LIVE — the locked template is now the app's deck card)**: `renderCard()`
  in `timber.html` now builds the v12 card for every deck card. The fixed-geometry
  420×543 card scales to any phone via a `--cs` transform (gestures untouched — the
  scale wrapper sits inside the flip faces; the trade-sheet back is wrapped to the
  same footprint). Data mapping from the locked PLANTS schema: `size` → HEIGHT/
  SPREAD rail values; `peak` → bloom calendar (range parser wraps year-end, e.g.
  Nandina Sep–Feb); `soil` splits at the first separator into value + warning
  (warning triangle auto-hidden when none); aspect passes the compass rule
  (facing shown only when the data names one — Nandina "S/W" shows, "Full sun"
  plants show Any aspect); photos load from `photos/<latin-slug>.jpg` with the
  hue-gradient + leaf watermark as the photo-less fallback; blank scores render
  blank rows (never faked). Kniphofia + Pennisetum added to the demo deck as the
  first complete v12 rows (real photos, 0–20 scores); their commercial fields
  stay blank until Oscar fills them. Regression suites updated for a 5-plant deck
  and green: 94/94 app tests, 8/8 edge tests, SW update path PASS.
- **v12 (NEW LOCKED TEMPLATE — full aesthetic re-sync)**: Oscar supplied the
  final approved card image (aa4c9fc4, 1103×1426) + the locked-template asset-kit
  master doc, declared it perfect, and asked for every saved aesthetic part to
  match it. Every painted asset was re-extracted from the new image at
  luminance-measured (not eyeballed) edges: frame, plaque, soil panel, band,
  blank crest (row-flank inpaint of the numerals), parchment swatch, and the six
  rating widgets — **secateurs are now yellow-handled Niwaki style per §18.3 (red
  banned)**. New template changes implemented: left rail is now two sections
  (HEIGHT value + SPREAD value, labels baked, values patched+live); growth
  marker is the extracted **faceted gold diamond** riding the capped scale
  segment; PPP heading is serif gold; soil panel restacks value → warning
  triangle → warning text (triangle auto-covered when a plant has no warning);
  aspect area drops the redundant "Full sun" prose (§18.2); **"wiggle room"
  leader implemented** — drawn at `sunMin` on the light scale only when that
  field has data (compass-style honesty; Pennisetum demo value flagged). Card
  aspect is now 1103:1426 (0.774). MD-file gems also implemented: **calibrated
  coordinate manifest** (`data/plinder-layout-manifest.json`, §26), **missing
  assets error visibly instead of being substituted** (§27), and a
  **verification script** `design/verify-cards.js` (§29 visual regression +
  rating-math assertions; baseline screenshot saved). Superseded v11 assets and
  mockups removed (git history keeps them); `design/card-builder.html` is the
  template of record. Both sample cards verified: fills equal data, months
  correct, zero missing assets.
- **v11.2 (data-driven card builder)**: Oscar supplied the locked "Plinder Plant
  Card — Reusable UI Design System" and asked to "code this into a slide builder,
  no aesthetic changes." Built `design/card-builder.html`: one `renderCard(plant)`
  turns any JSON plant object into the locked v11.1 card — no per-plant HTML.
  Plant objects use the **plants.csv / CARD-STATS.md schema** (scores 0–20,
  sunNeed 0–100) so the builder, CSV, and portfolio brief are one pipeline.
  Aesthetic untouched; the only changes are structural: IDs→classes (many cards
  per page), all values bound from data, the hardiness crest uses the blank shell
  + code-rendered H-number (any band, per spec §22), a screen-reader `<dl>` mirror
  (spec §12), and geometric quarter-fill ratings verified per card (Kniphofia
  0.75/1/1.5, Pennisetum 1/3/2). Sample data: `data/plinder-cards.sample.json`.
  Deferred from the spec (noted, not skipped): light tolerance/optimal bands are
  omitted because the LOCKED treatment (spec §18.2) drops them; a rotating compass
  needle is pending a separated needle asset (both current samples are "Any
  aspect", so no needle is shown — compass rule holds). Not yet wired into
  `timber.html`'s live deck — that's the next brick.
- **v11.1 (Oscar refinement pass, via ChatGPT micro-edit brief)**: three layout
  edits, no restyle. (1) **Growth-speed scale** restored to the earlier preferred
  treatment — thin warm-off-white vertical line, small **gold diamond marker**
  (45°), `Fast`/`Slow` ends, `GROWTH SPEED` vertical, transparent over the photo
  (replaces the painted-leaf marker + High/Low). (2) **`PLANT POWER POINTS`** added
  as a delicate horizontal gold heading floating just above the main plaque; the
  now-redundant **vertical PPP baked on the left rail was patched out** (clean rail
  texture overlay) so it isn't shown twice — the one frame change in this pass,
  flagged for Oscar. (3) **Aspect/light band decomposed & compacted**: sun icon
  removed, compass shrunk ~20% (separate `compass-sm` sprite), `Full sun` relocated
  into the left ASPECT text block, gradient bar kept as a marker-free sprite
  (`light-bar`, stale baked tick clone-patched out) with a code-drawn marker driven
  by `sunNeed`; painted band interior blanked to clean parchment, painted border
  kept; panel ~15% shorter. New assets: `art/compass-sm.png`, `art/light-bar.png`.
  Data still outranks art (aspect "Any aspect" not the painted "South/West").
- **v11 (built from the reference's own pixels)**: Oscar rejected hand-drawn
  icons ("the emojis suck, the aesthetic is far worse than chatgpt's model") and
  asked for the ChatGPT reference card to be used directly, changing nothing of
  its layout or aesthetic. Strategy: the reference image IS the card —
  `art/frame-full.png` is the base; the live photo covers the interior; the
  painted plaque / soil panel / aspect band / crest / stature label are cropped
  whole (`art/*-full.png`, rounded feathered masks at MEASURED pixel edges, not
  eyeballed ones) and overlaid at their exact reference positions; only
  plant-specific value zones are covered with matched parchment patches
  (feather-compensated oversize) and re-rendered live from plants.csv. Rating
  widgets re-extracted as true-alpha sprites (parchment keyed out) so chips
  carry no background tone. Data outranked the art everywhere they disagreed:
  painted "South / West" → "Any aspect" (compass rule; the painted rose names
  no facing so it stays), painted "June–August" → Jul–Oct timeline (v10 rule),
  painted 2/5 thirst → 1/5 (powerWater 80), painted 0.5/5 pests → 0.75/5
  (powerPest 85), painted light marker (~76%) → 88% (lightLevel), imperial
  stature → "75 cm H × 60 cm W" (size field). Tolerance bands dropped from the
  light slider — the reference art has none. The pristine painted H5 crest is
  used as-is (Kniphofia IS H5). Known open items: crest variants for other
  hardiness numbers (inpaint attempt looked patchy, parked); careLevel still
  demo 1.5/5 pending the column decision; ~2px painted-marker-tip remnant on
  the track edge (reads as a tick mark); 4:5 card vs full-height deck aspect
  unresolved. Assets in `art/`, mockup + extraction scripts in `design/`.
- **v1** (original spec): dark gradient card + leaf watermark, no photos. Locked
  until Oscar reopened the design.
- **v2 feedback (Oscar)**: photos in; wood frame on ALL cards; trading-card layout
  fine to borrow as generic convention (no Pokémon art/fonts/symbols); LESS paper —
  photo dominant, slim top + bottom panels only; keep the fact oblongs; coffee-stain
  vintage paper; compass instead of sun for direction-bearing aspect data; fix leaf
  photo centring; dedupe "well-drained" repetition.
- **v3 (Oscar)**: two-photo merge recipe approved for trial — flower/habit photo
  full-bleed at edges, detail photo soft-windowed (elliptical mask ~46%x26% at
  50% 40%) into the clear band above the Water box. Dedupe rule caught its second
  live case (Agastache drainage stated in both Water and Soil; trimmed at source).
- **v4 (Oscar's vibe image, rebuilt original)**: gold hardiness SHIELD top-right;
  compass as a 44px parchment BADGE on the photo (solves legibility); stats header
  renamed "GROWER STATS" — Oscar correctly ruled "Cultivar Power Stats" wrong for
  straight species (cultivar = named cultivated variety in quotes only). Star
  ratings from the vibe image REJECTED as invented data; replaced with honest
  derivations only: hardiness as pips on the real H1–H7 scale + tolerance chips
  emitted only when the `resilience` field states them. Footer: front says
  "⇅ Double-tap to dig deeper"; rhyming line reserved for empty state. Back keeps
  the full trade sheet and gains a 🔖 Remember button (double-tap only flips;
  saving is a deliberate button press — no accidental saves).
- **v4b (Kniphofia)**: proposed resolution to the Position question demonstrated —
  compass badge only when aspect names a facing; otherwise the Position oblong
  stays on the card (sun/shade wording is real data, never dropped). Awaiting
  Oscar's sign-off. Dedupe caught cases 3 and 4 (drought in Water+Resilience,
  winter-wet in Soil+Resilience).
- **v10 (design-system doc adopted)**: Oscar supplied a full "Plinder Plant Card
  Design System" md + generated reference image. Adopted as CARD-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md
  (with Timber addendum mapping it to our CSV columns and vanilla stack). Key
  changes vs v9: forest-green ornamental border + gold trim replaces walnut;
  STATURE vertical rail; growth-speed transparent overlay on photo; plaque rows
  become Bloom (month timeline, not a score), Pests (mite emblem + spray-bottle
  widgets = (100−powerPest)/20), Thirst (drops = (100−powerWater)/20), Care
  (secateurs — needs new careLevel column, demo until then); light scale
  shade→sun with tolerance bands; quarter-step geometric clipping (never
  opacity). Measured acceptance: centred, heading horizontal, fills match data,
  timeline unclipped. Generated image's invented "South/West" aspect and
  "June–August" bloom rejected — data outranks art.
- **v9 (Oscar's refined composition — "so much closer")**: unified warm-cream
  paper card with FRAMED photo window (photo unobstructed inside its window —
  replaces the full-bleed-photo paradigm); Power Points panel overlaps the
  window's bottom edge; ornate vintage compass gets its own "facing" panel
  (needle to stated facing; muted + "any aspect" caption when data names none —
  compass rule survives); LIGHT promoted to a front spectrum slider
  (navy→gold, marker from lightLevel); blue LISTEN pill for pronunciation;
  Water text + Prune move to the card BACK (front = at-a-glance). Thirst =
  100 − droughtTolerance rendered as blue droplet pips (v8 decision kept);
  detailed hand-drawn icons (sprout/berries+flower/ladybird/watering-can)
  replace system emoji (v8). Wholesome cream palette from Oscar's reference.
- **v6 (Oscar art-direction brief — major pivot)**: from "playful trading card"
  to "premium botanical collectible". Thin matte aged-walnut frame (not glossy,
  not thick) + ONE antique-brass keyline; warm ivory translucent panels; deep
  green serif plant name + restrained sans-serif care text; monochrome ENGRAVED
  botanical emblems (no emoji, no cartoon icons); H5 as an enamel-style medallion
  in the title plaque; Water/Light/Soil/Care unified into ONE parchment panel
  separated by thin rules (not four boxes); footer "Double tap to master."
  Photo target raised to >=70% unobstructed. To hit it, PLANT POWER POINTS +
  the lightLevel spectrum slider MOVE TO THE CARD BACK (front = photo + plaque +
  care panel only); leaf pips replace gold stars, with numeric score alongside.
  Measured front photo-clear: 63% fully-opaque (panels are ~91% translucent so
  more shows through) — short of strict 70%; closing the gap needs single-line
  care values or a shorter care panel. Awaiting Oscar's call on that + overall
  sign-off. This supersedes the v2/v4 wood+coffee-paper look if approved.
- **v5 (Oscar)**: stats section renamed **PLANT POWER POINTS**; star ratings
  REINSTATED on Oscar's structural fix — scores become real reviewable CSV
  columns (26–30) generated against the rubric in §1b, resolving the earlier
  "invented data" objection. Tooling extended: importer accepts 0–100 or blank
  for score columns; export bug fixed (missing keys wrote literal "undefined").
  All 124 existing rows migrated with blank scores — to be rated in Gemini
  batches and reviewed by Oscar.
- **Open**: final design not yet declared; Position rule (v4b) awaiting sign-off;
  Remember list feature approved in concept, not yet built; fallback for
  photo-less plants = gradient+watermark inside the same frame.
