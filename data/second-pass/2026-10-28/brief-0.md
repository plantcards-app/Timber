# Second-pass brief 0 — 1 plants

You are fact-checking UK garden-centre plant cards. Use WebSearch (load it with ToolSearch "select:WebSearch,WebFetch" first).
rhs.org.uk pages are blocked by the proxy: search-result snippets of RHS pages are acceptable evidence; say when you relied on
one. Do NOT edit any file except the one named below. Never invent: a value you cannot find is "" with source "not found".

For EACH plant find: (1) the RHS hardiness band H1a–H7 (give the RHS plant id), else the best other source and say so;
(2) RHS ultimate height and spread, written as the deck writes them ("1–1.5 m", "30–50 cm", ">12 m", "8 m+");
(3) flowering or peak-interest months as Mon-Mon (e.g. "Jun-Aug"); (4) toxicity: the RHS flags (harmful if eaten / skin
irritant / toxic to pets) and the ASPCA listing, or "no listing found"; (5) the accepted name, whether the cultivar exists,
and the TRADE ('code') form if it is a PBR plant; (6) any UK compliance point (Xylella host, Schedule 9, plant passport).

1. Catharanthus roseus Soirée 'Cerise White Eye' (Madagascar Periwinkle (bedding vinca)) [batch:batch-as-sent.json] — claimed: hardiness H1c; height blank; spread blank; peak Jun-Sep; foliage evergreen; toxicity "All parts are toxic if eaten and can cause vomiting and more serious effects in people and pets. Keep away from children, dogs and cats." (prints harmful); compliance "none"

Schema (one object per plant, every field present, "" where not found, every value with its source):
[

    "height":    { "value": "1–1.5 m", "source": "RHS 12345" },
    "spread":    { "value": "1–1.5 m", "source": "RHS 12345" },

    "name":      { "accepted": "Genus species 'Cultivar'", "trade": "Genus species TRADE ('code')", "exists": true, "source": "..." },
    "compliance": { "value": "...", "source": "..." },
    "notes": ["anything else the session should know, one line each"]
  }

Then reply with a five-line summary: how many agreed, which disagreed and on what.
